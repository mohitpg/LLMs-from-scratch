Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────One day in July, a scruffy, dark-haired, emerald-eyed boy was dozing off in his cupboard under the stairs, dreaming of flying motorbikes and the sort. He woke up with a start, when his Aunt Petunia, a thin, blonde woman with an unusually large amount of neck (it was useful for spying on the neighbours over the hedge), rapped harshly on his cupboard door. “Up!” Aunt Petunia instructed, more coldly than she normally did. She had been treating him that way since the incident involving the boa constrictor. Idly, Harry wondered if it had found its way to Brazil yet. If it did, Harry hoped it would be happy there. Ever since he could talk, Harry had learned that most times, it was best to pretend that he was non-existent, to only talk when addressed, and most importantly— to  never ask questions. Then where was a ten-(nearly eleven!)-year-old boy supposed to get his answers, then? Well, Harry had found that most of the answers he wanted could either be attained through observing, or… well, there was no second option, so he supposed the questions with unattainable answers just had to remain unanswered, stored away in the depths of his mind. His most recent question with an unattainable answer was the boa constrictor incident, of course. The glass had disappeared— disappeared! Judging from how his Aunt and Uncle were treating him, Harry would have to simply assume that they blamed  him, which wasn’t really that much of a surprise. Whenever Dudley messed up his homework, it was always Harry’s fault for disturbing him. Perhaps he was being too loud while he washed the dishes. It was always something along the line of that. “Boy! Are you up yet?” came Petunia’s sharp voice once more. Harry sighed, composing himself. It would be no use to throw a tantrum— besides, he really, really,  really  didn’t want to be on the receiving end of Dudley’s new Smeltings stick. Not that Dudley would ever have a good enough hand-to-eye coordination to be able to hit him with it— no. It was just that his cousin carried the stick  everywhere, which meant that it was an easily accessible weapon to Uncle Vernon, should the man feel the urge to hit him. Uncle Vernon preferred to punch Harry most of the time— but that man’s arms weren’t really that long, and he sometimes had trouble catching Harry, as the boy was small and nimble enough to cause suspicion. When it came down to it, an angry Uncle Vernon was just Dudley’s favourite sport (Harry-hunting), but played by an adult. At the end of the day, however, Uncle Vernon would still be able to get his hands on Harry. It wasn’t like there was any place Harry could go to hide from his Uncle until the man had calmed down, so another survival tip Harry had learned early on was to gauge how angry his Uncle was. If it seemed like Uncle Vernon would only get angrier if he couldn’t catch Harry, well, Harry would prefer to just get the beating over sooner than later. Slinking into the kitchen as quietly as he could, Harry tried not to reel back from the smell. He quickly found the source of it— a huge, metal tub by the sink. Inside the tub were what appeared to be decade-old kitchen rags soaking in grey water. Knowing how much Aunt Petunia hated questions, Harry decided to keep his mouth shut. Aunt Petunia had already made breakfast that morning— a surprise, really. Harry had expected to have to do it, but he didn’t say anything and moved to clean the pans that Aunt Petunia had used. The smell of his Aunt’s dishwasher— lemon— soothed his emotions more than they should. Washing the dishes and cleaning in general always did make the scruffy, small boy feel calm. The chores were a routine, something that he was always expected to do, something that was consistent, quite unlike his Uncle’s unpredictable temper. “What’s that terrible smell?” Dudley, unlike Harry, had no qualms about keeping his mouth shut. Then again, Harry supposed the boy didn’t have to be on the receiving end of Aunt Petunia’s tight-lipped glare every time a sentence finished with a question mark. “Harry’s new school uniform.” Aunt Petunia brushed it off, like the tub of grey matter was a minor issue at most. Meanwhile, Uncle Vernon had already made his way into the kitchen, and he, like his son, scrunched up his nose at the repulsive stink. Plopping onto the chair (Harry wondered how long it would be until the chair legs gave way), the man opened the newspaper while Dudley banged his stick on the table, making Harry wince. When Harry was on his last pan (for the thousandth time, he wondered if Aunt Petunia must use  that much oil when cooking breakfast), there came a click from the letter box, and the flop of letters on the doormat. Without even looking up, Uncle Vernon instructed from behind his paper: “Get the post, Dudley.” “Make Harry get it.” responded Dudley defiantly. “Get the post, boy.” Harry paused, wondering for a moment if he would get reprimanded for leaving the last pan unwashed before he retrieved the post. In the span of half a second, he decided that he didn’t want to risk it, and rinsed the pan as quickly as the water flow would allow. Wiping his hands on one of Dudley’s old pants, Harry set the pan onto the drying rack and quietly walked out of the kitchen, passing his cupboard on his way to the front door. Lying on the doormat forlornly were three letters— a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge, who would mostly leave him alone if he was quiet; A brown envelope that Harry guessed was either the electricity  or water bill, and lastly a thick letter, made with yellowish parchment. Curiosity got the best of him as he brought it to the top, eyes bulging when he read the first line. 
 Mr H. Potter 
The letter was addressed to him, Harry processed slowly. A part of him started to feel excited— perhaps he had a long-lost relative from his father’s side that had risen to claim him? Surely no relative could be any worse than the Dursleys. Two seconds passed by, within which Harry chastised himself— it would do no good to get excited. He didn’t want to set high expectations, as they more often than not lead to high disappointments. Luckily for Harry, his cupboard was on his return route to the kitchen, which meant that he could, very discreetly, slip  his  letter (even though he didn’t want to feel excited, it was rather thrilling to think of it as  his letter  .) through the little shafts on his cupboard door. He could only imagine how angry his Aunt and Uncle would be if they learned that he had received a letter— if he had to choose, the most likely outcome was getting locked in his cupboard  again after watching Uncle Vernon tear the letter to pieces before him. “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” The man chuckled at his own joke. As quickly as possible, Harry walked back into his kitchen, wearing mismatched socks that diminished the little noise he made against the floor (Harry was rather proud of his ability to walk completely silently). Quietly, he set the two remaining letters on the table in front of Uncle Vernon, retreating back to the sink to wipe up the splashes of water he had caused when wrestling the oily pans. The smell of his uniforms (dyed from Dudley’s old things) was strongest by the sink, but he managed to push the urge to vomit back down. The night before, Dudley had been parading around in his new Smeltings uniform, so while his Uncle and Aunt had been busy getting emotional over their ‘Ickle Dudleykins’ (Harry had never been gladder that his Aunt wasn’t affectionate enough to give him a similar nickname), he snagged more dinner than usual. By the time he was done wiping the sink, Dudley was already three-quarters through his breakfast, which consisted of a whole platter of greasy bacon. It didn’t look very healthy to Harry, but both Dudley and Uncle Vernon liked bacon, so Aunt Petunia made it for breakfast rather often. His Aunt had already set aside a small plate of bacon for Harry, accompanied by the pieces of burnt scrambled egg that Dudley refused to eat. Uncle Vernon ripped open the brown envelope— the bill— with distaste, setting it aside in favour of the postcard. “Marge’s ill,” He informed Aunt Petunia as he read the back of the card, “Ate a funny whelk…” Harry tuned out the rest of the conversation, silently retrieving his plate before sitting himself into the corner of the kitchen, where there was a rug. It was better than sitting on the floor, as Harry’s back was still hurting from when he slept on his lumpy mattress (which was on the floor) the night before. It didn’t take long for him to finish his skimpy meal, so once he was done, he placed the plate into the sink and washed it up. Soon, the rest of the Dursleys were done eating, too, and discarded their plates for him to clean. The family left him in the kitchen to clean up, which Harry was grateful for. He appreciated the rare moments of quietness and peace that he could get. For one, Aunt Petunia wouldn’t be snapping at him for  whatever reason, Uncle Vernon wouldn’t be sneering and calling him ‘boy’ (he thought that his name was ‘boy’ until he was seven and had to go to primary school), and Dudley wouldn’t be making fun of him or whacking him with the Smeltings stick. Harry could only think about  one  thing as he washed the dishes. It repeated in his head  over  and  over, a restless chant that wouldn’t leave him alone.  His letter. His letter in his cupboard. His letter, in his cupboard, addressed to his cupboard. The urge to open it was rising rapidly, but Harry knew he had to bide his time— it wouldn’t do good to let the Dursleys know too early. Knowing them, they would snatch it away from him, and that would be the end of it. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────It was a lovely afternoon outside, but Harry wanted  anything but to go outside. Dudley had left to go play with Piers, Dennis, Gordon and… Was it Mark? Harry pursed his lips for a moment, trying to recall what they were calling each other as he ran away… No, it wasn’t Mark… Oh, right, it was Malcolm. Dudley had left to go play with his friends, which meant they were all outside, which meant that the last place Harry wanted to be was  outside . With Dudley. Harry was rather tired from his restless night— his spine was practically sitting on the cold floor of his cupboard, and at that point his lumpy mattress made little to no difference. He didn’t particularly feel like playing ‘Harry-hunting’ at the moment. Not that they’d listen if he told them so, anyway. Uncle Vernon, who had taken the day off, was watching the telly with Aunt Petunia, and they hadn’t bothered with him ever since they left him in the kitchen, so Harry felt like it was  safe. Harry snuck out of the kitchen, silent as ever. The telly was still going on in the living, so Harry crouched next to his cupboard door, hand on the handle. There was some sort of drama show going on, and the female lead had just burst into tears, accompanied by heart-wrenching background music. Luckily for Harry, he didn’t have to wait long, as his knees were starting to hurt. The male lead burst into the room and started yelling about who had upset the female lead. The noise was loud enough for Harry to sneak back into the cupboard without his Aunt or Uncle hearing the squeak of the door. Breathing quietly, Harry’s eyes shone as he fumbled for the letter, sitting obediently on his mattress. Taking care not to make any noise, Harry traced his hand over the purple wax seal, holding it up so he could see it properly under the light that strewn in from the shafts of his door. Amazed, he carefully ran his fingers over the four animals pictured— a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a  snake . The snake’s eyes seemed to be brighter than the rest, which caught Harry’s attention. He studied it curiously, half-wishing that he could be opening the letter in better lighting even though he’d rather not risk it. All of a sudden, the snake blinked at him, causing the scruffy boy to do a double take. Did an animal— on a wax seal— just  blink ? Harry rubbed his eyes and looked again. The snake looked as normal as it could be, one of the four creatures surrounding the ‘H’ in the centre. Deciding that his myopia had just gotten worse (yes, Harry knew what myopia was— he’d read it once in his primary school library, which was his preferred place to hide from Dudley during school hours. The librarian was very kind and understanding about how isolated he was from his yearmates— no one wanted to get close to Harry-The-Target-Of-Dudley’s-Bullying-Potter. In fact, she even promised not to tell anyone about his bullying situation upon his request, and let him take his meals into her office to avoid his bullies. Harry carefully tore the envelope so that the wax seal would be undamaged. Just as he was about to take the letter out, his cupboard door burst open. “If you’ve got nothing better to do, go weed the yard—” Aunt Petunia faltered as her eyes trailed down to the letter in her nephew’s hands. “Give me that!” She snapped, snatching it away from him, much to Harry’s dismay. Her cheeks flared a sharp red before turning a sickly green as realisation dawned onto her. “V-V-Vernon!” She squeaked, suddenly breathless and rapidly turning to the colour of old porridge, “Come quick!” “No!” For the first time in a while, Harry opened his mouth and spoke. He hardly said anything anymore— once, Piers’s mother, who had come over for the boys’ sleepover, asked if Harry was mute. “It’s— It’s mine.” Deciding he had said enough now, Harry shut his mouth and hoped that he wouldn’t get punished too badly for speaking on impulse. “Not anymore,” Uncle Vernon said, eyes gleaming beadily. If anything, he looked delighted that Harry had been so upset he’d used his voice. That delight quickly faded as soon as he saw the letter Aunt Petunia was holding up, though. The man, like his wife, flushed red in anger, turning into vomit-green as if he were a traffic light. “T-This is…” The two stared at each other for a moment, standing in front of Harry’s cupboard. “Vernon… Look at the address… How… How do they know where he sleeps? You… You don’t think they’re… They’re spying on us?” Aunt Petunia’s whispers trembled as she looked progressively more horrified by the moment. “Watching— spying— following us,” Vernon replied, even though he didn’t have the thought to keep his voice down. He looked around wildly, as if a man would suddenly appear and introduce himself as the spy. Then, as if he’d suddenly remembered Harry’s existence, the man put on his darkest glare. “Back to your cupboard!” He barked. Harry stared at him for a moment, not wanting to point out that he  was in his cupboard. “O-Out.” Aunt Petunia said, still shaking. “Get out. Go weed the yard.” Harry’s heart clenched slightly, and for a moment he wanted to refuse— that was before he thought it out. Dudley— and his gang— Would do less damage than an angry Uncle Vernon, which was not something Harry felt like risking. If Aunt Petunia wanted to give him a chance to get away, he wasn’t going to turn it down. Hurriedly, Harry stepped out from his cupboard and to the front door, closing it before his Uncle could blink. A part of him wanted to be furious. That letter was  his  , and he hadn’t even gotten to read it. The other part blamed himself— he should’ve been more sensible. He could’ve hidden the letter under his mattress and no one would be wiser— and then after the Dursleys had gone to bed, after the house was completely dark— Harry could take out the flashlight that Dudley had ‘lost’ after coming back from summer camp— and  then it would be truly safe for him to read it. Glumly, Harry rolled up his sleeves, not wanting to incur his Aunt’s anger. He wasn’t exceptionally keen on her coming out to yell at him for slacking off. There would be a whole, hushed tirade about how  kind  she and her husband were being, how they were generous for keeping and feeding him. Knowing Aunt Petunia, she would throw in something about his parents, mentioning that they were  foolish  and  drunk  and that they probably purposely got themselves in the crash because they didn’t want  him . Eventually, the sun began to set and Dudley thundered back into the front yard of number four, Privet Drive. His cousin made a dismayed expression when he realised Harry had been outside— the opportunity to have a day of Harry-hunting had slipped by. Without saying a word, Harry slipped into the kitchen, clothes damp with sweat that the afternoon sun had rained onto him. His fingers relaxed when they made contact with the sponge, and he set himself to begin washing the dishes with practiced efficiency. Most of the tension that had built up through the day seeped out from his hands into the foams, washed away when he rinsed the pans and pots his Aunt used to make dinner. Harry chided himself when he was nearly done with the dishes— he was lucky that he managed to eat extra the night before. From what he heard, Dudley had a picnic at the park with his friends, which was why his cousin didn’t return for lunch. Since Dudley didn’t come back for lunch, Aunt Petunia hadn’t seen the point in calling  Harry  in for lunch. Admittedly, Harry was a little hungry from having skipped a meal— but he, just as quickly, reminded himself that he could’ve been  hungrier , and that he should be thankful that he wasn’t. Dinner was a brief affair, similar to how breakfast had gone. Aunt Petunia had set aside a plate filled with scraps and burnt food, and Harry had accepted without complaint. Once more, he squished himself into the corner, eating as quickly as he could in case Dudley changed his mind and decided that he wanted Harry’s scraps, too. Once they finished eating, Dudley and Uncle Vernon headed into the living room to watch some telly— Harry remembered that it was Thursday, that Dudley’s favourite show was starting soon. Aunt Petunia, who wasn’t all that interested, had stayed behind to ‘make sure Harry didn’t break anything’, despite the fact he had always been careful and had never broken anything since he was six. “Could I have my letter?” Harry asked quietly, deciding that the risk was worth it. Aunt Petunia didn’t hit him often, and even when she did, it was a slap on his cheek and not a punch onto his ribs. “Please?” “Absolutely not!” She hissed sharply, frightening Harry to the point that he jumped into the air, hunching and hanging his head down in an effort to make himself appear smaller. “Don’t think about asking again,” She wriggled her finger at him, her eyes ablaze with scorn. “Vernon burned the letter. Don’t think about seeing it again, either.” Harry nodded quietly, back pressed up against the kitchen wall. He stood under the scrutiny of his Aunt’s gaze for a moment longer before the woman scoffed and stalked away, leaving him alone. Weighed down by helplessness, Harry slipped down the wall until he was on the floor, feeling sick to the stomach. Someone out there had reached out to him— and just because he got careless, his hope got burned away, just like his letter. Before he realised what was happening, tears slipped down Harry’s cheeks, and with all the emotion of a neglected ten-year-old, the last Potter alive wept silently. In the living room, Petunia joined her husband and child, pretending she couldn’t hear the sniffles originating from the kitchen. For a brief moment, when Harry looked up at her, wearing the hopeful face of a child, Petunia had seen her sister for the first time in over ten years. Lily’s eyes had gazed up into hers, and upon catching herself, the woman had lashed out on her nephew, crushing any hope he had of a world beyond number 4, Privet Drive. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────The next evening— Friday evening— Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before. He visited Harry, who was mourning quietly, in his cupboard. Harry had tried not to look too bewildered as his Uncle squeezed himself into the small space under the stairs, causing a few spiders to fall when he hit the doorframe by accident. Harry stared at his Uncle as the man took a few large, shuddering breaths— the boy wanted to point out there was a spider on his Uncle’s shoulder, but thought better of it when Uncle Vernon  painfully arranged a smile onto his face. “Er— Yes— Harry.” Uncle Vernon began. Harry couldn’t remember the last time his Uncle had addressed him by his name, so he immediately tensed up— Something serious was going on if his Uncle had taken the time to remember his nephew’s name. “About your cupboard…” Uncle Vernon cleared his throat, looking constipated as he fought to remain smiling. “Your aunt and I have been thinking… You’re really getting big for it… We think it might be nice if you moved to Dudley’s second bedroom.” Harry squinted at Uncle Vernon for a couple seconds longer, hovering on the possibility that the man had knocked his head a little too hard on the doorframe and had a concussion. “So— er— take your things upstairs.” Uncle Vernon adjusted his jaw, as if it physically hurt him to smile at Harry for more than two seconds. Deciding not to question anything, Harry nodded and gathered his things— a stack of Dudley’s old clothes, a couple of his old textbooks— and waited for Uncle Vernon as the man struggled to get out of the doorframe. The stairs rattled slightly when he finally broke free, and Harry held his breath so he wouldn’t breathe in the dust and sand falling from the ceiling of his cupboard. The Dursleys house had four bedrooms: One for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (Usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all his toys and things that wouldn’t fit in his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip to move everything he owned from the cupboard to his new bedroom. Practically everything inside the room was broken, which meant that all of it was unwanted trash— just like Harry himself. Downstairs, Dudley’s bawls of ‘I don’t want him there!’ and ‘I  need  that room’ and ‘Make him get out!’ drifted up from the stairs and into Dudley’s old— er,  Harry ’s new room. From the snippets that Harry could catch, Aunt Petunia was standing her ground, placating her son with ‘I’ll buy you some new toys this weekend, alright Dudleykins?’. He listened for a little longer, just to be sure that the Dursleys wouldn’t chuck him back downstairs— he didn’t want to start cleaning up only for his efforts to be wasted. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────



Notes:

Ever since I started reading Harry Potter, I've been wondering— What if Harry was not as impulsive, what if he was sensible and quiet and kept to himself? Personally, as someone with a very cautious personality, I don't like the way Harry went about with certain things.Anyway, I've been reading a lot of Severitus lately, and I thought that Snape and Harry would get along a hell lot better if Harry wasn't half as impulsive as he was in the original series. So, two days ago, I took out the Philosopher's Stone and decided that you know what, I'm going to rewrite the whole series.Also, I'm looking for two beta-readers! Contact me if you have either a Tumblr account or a Discord account, because I'll be sending you the link to my google docs that way.Leave a comment and tell me what you think! Toodles! (Is that how the word is used?)30/12/2023 Update:Black Mulberry: The PDF Version- as asked for, here is the PDF version of the book (because AO3 exports with chapter notes and I know I have a ton of those) so here's a clean, chapter-only PDF of the entire book, straight from my 300-paged Google Docs. Much love.

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────The next morning during breakfast, everyone was rather quiet— with the exception of Dudley, that was. He screamed, whacked Harry with his Smeltings stick, kicked his mother, whacked Harry with his Smeltings stick, threw his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, whacked Harry with his Smeltings stick, and still didn’t get his room back. To be fair, he hit his father, too, but not as often as he hit Harry, which was odd, because at that point Harry was  actively staying at least three metres away from the stick at all times. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia shared countless dark glances throughout breakfast. Speaking of which, Harry had been invited to  sit  for breakfast, for once. The vacant chair that was more often sat on by Marge than Harry was  offered to the boy. Suspicion rose quickly in him. Did they want him to sit closer so that Dudley could hit him more often? He had five bruises and was still counting. By the end of breakfast, he should have another five more. When the post arrived, Harry made a move to get up to retrieve it. Much to his (and Dudley’s) surprise, Uncle Vernon, who Harry supposed was trying to be nice to him, made Dudley go get it. Clearly, Dudley wasn’t very happy about it, if the irregular banging of his Smeltings stick down the hallway was anything to go by. Harry thought the tension was going to strangle him, from the way his Uncle and Aunt kept looking at each other, and then back at  him —“No way! There’s a letter addressed to Harry,” came Dudley’s shout from the hallway, “ Mr H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —” Uncle Vernon burst out of his chair with a strangled cry, darting down the hallway as fast as he could. The chair scraped on the floor as Aunt Petunia stood abruptly, face paler than her faded flower-print curtains. A series of howls and cries scrambled down the hall as Uncle Vernon wrestled Dudley to the floor for the letter. Aunt Petunia left the dining room to join them, and Harry was glad he hadn’t gotten up either when both his Aunt and Uncle returned, looking rather beaten up. If Harry had to take a wild guess— the Smeltings stick. “Go to your cupboard— I mean— your room,” Uncle Vernon panted, looking quite like a ripe tomato with his puffed, red cheeks. The letter was held, looking rather miserable in its crumpled state, in his hand. The man took a moment to gasp for breath before he continued. “Dudley— go— just go.” Obediently, Harry left the room, moving out of the way when Dudley thundered past. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia rarely said no to Dudley. In fact, Harry could count the number of times with his two hands. It was rather strange that Dudley was more upset than Harry about not being able to see  Harry ’s letter, but then again, Harry was used to disappointment. As he sat on his bed, Harry wondered how the sender had known he’d switched bedrooms. In his first letter, his address had included ‘The Cupboard under the Stairs’, and now in his second letter, it was written ‘The Smallest Bedroom’. It was rather peculiar how they knew of the change. It was even more peculiar that they seemed to know that he hadn’t read his first letter. A spark of hope reignited inside Harry’s chest as he realised that the sender of his letter—  letters— was likely to try again. Looking out onto the gravel of Privet Drive, Harry managed a slight smile, allowing himself a moment of happiness. There was someone out there, determined enough to reach him— determined enough to send a second letter. There was someone out there, looking for him, writing to him. There was someone out there. 
 There was someone out there.  
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────One of Dudley’s old alarm clocks— the one with a Mickey Mouse face behind the hands, and round, black ears as the bells that were struck by the hammer— rang quietly at 6am sharp. Harry had managed to snag a lighter from the kitchen the night before and used it to heat the dents of the clock where Dudley had dropped it before blowing on it quickly in hopes that it would expand and contract quickly, bringing the metal back to its original shape. With his small hands, Harry had pried the hammer away, leaving it so that the clock only vibrated when the time arrived. He dressed himself quietly, pulling one of Dudley’s old beige sweaters over his head. The sleeves hung over his arms, so he folded them up, in preparation of doing the morning dishes in an hour or two. The Dursleys gave him Dudley’s old socks, but all of them had holes in them and made his feet feel cold. Harry had resorted to stealing  one sock from the washing machine, and since Dudley refused to wear his socks unless they were a matching pair, Harry would get the other side while it was still in a decent state. Of course, that meant that he couldn’t wear his socks matching, but that was okay.Harry crept down the stairs quietly, clinging onto the railing as he skipped the fifth step— it creaked, and he knew that because he would count how many steps Dudley took before stomping on the loose step. It was completely dark in the house, with the nearest source of light being the lamppost outside— and  that was blocked by a giant fir tree, so it wasn’t that much help. His plan was to slip out of the house and greet the postman by the corner of Privet Drive to collect Number Four’s letters. Then, he could return and leave the rest of the letters on the doormat, as if they had been slipped in through the letter-box.  His letter could wait snugly under his mattress until it was midnight, until the rest of the house was asleep. Then he could use Dudley’s flashlight and read it in the dark. At least, that  was the plan. His heart hammered in his chest as he reached the end of the staircase, creeping through the dark hall to the front— Harry’s breath caught in his throat, drowning out the erratic  thump-thump-thump  of his heart. Lying sprawled across the hallway was Uncle Vernon— well, he couldn’t tell if it was Uncle Vernon, but there was a giant mass taking up the entire floor, and he was pretty sure it wasn’t Aunt Petunia. There was no way little Harry, with his scrawny hands and short legs, could cross the hallway and make it to the door without waking his Uncle. Glumly, Harry slinked back into his room, drooping as he spotted the mailman making his rounds. With nothing else to do, Harry decided to shift through the rest of Dudley’s broken toys, picking a few of them apart for their parts. He was still rather proud of himself for fixing the Mickey Mouse clock— Dudley had got it from Disneyland (he was left at Mrs. Figgs for the entire weekend) and had thrown it against the wall when he had a tantrum about getting a new computer. Among the heap of unwanted objects were a small, working tank that Dudley once drove over the neighbour’s dog (Harry wondered if he could get his hands on a screwdriver; He wanted to see the mechanics inside the tank), Dudley’s first ever television set, which he put his foot through when his favourite show got cancelled, a bird cage for the parrot that Dudley traded for a real air-rifle, which was  also in the room with a bent tip because Dudley sat on it. The other shelves were filled with books, which Harry had either already read or had no interest in. Before he knew it, an hour had passed. The sun had started rising over the brown rooftops of Privet Drive, and birds were soaring across the sky in search of the early worms. He watched them wistfully for a moment, wishing that he, too, could fly away. Deciding to get up before Aunt Petunia woke him up unceremoniously, Harry slipped down the stairways once more, eyeing the stack of letters by a snoring Uncle Vernon’s head. Aunt Petunia entered the kitchen fifteen minutes later, nodding approvingly when she saw Harry frying his second batch of bacon. There was already one plate on the table, oil dripping down onto the white ceramic, much to Harry’s disgust (he’d never say that aloud, of course). “You better not burn that.” Aunt Petunia said off-handedly as she took the remaining four eggs from the fridge. Harry only nodded his acknowledgement, choosing not to say anything if necessary— words would only cause trouble, after all. Harry never seemed to say anything right around the Dursleys. “Bah!” Uncle Vernon stomped into the room, startling Harry when he slammed the kitchen door shut. “Another dratted letter!” The phrase made the scruffy boy turn immediately, and he saw that his Uncle had spoken the truth. Another heavy-looking, yellowy-parchment was in his Uncle’s hands. He could only look on in horror as Uncle Vernon lit a match, placed the letter on an old ceramic plate, and let the parchment catch fire. A cruel smile widened across his Uncle’s lips when he caught Harry looking. The boy jolted and turned back to the dishes instantly, biting his lip and repeating  do not cry do not cry do not cry.  Tears— the ones from him, anyway— were not tolerated in the Dursley household. If he let a single droplet slide from his eyelids, he would be in for a whole lecture on how ‘pathetic’ and ‘emotional’ he was. Dudley cried (well,  wailed  ) because he wanted attention from his parents— Harry  didn’t  cry because he  didn’t want attention from his Aunt and Uncle. Once upon a time, Aunt Petunia’s attention was all that Harry ever wanted. He would wake by the crack of dawn, dutifully helping his Aunt with any chores, never once complaining and doing everything she instructed. He would endure the boiling oil that splashed at him while he fried bacon if it meant he could get a nod of approval from his Aunt. He would spend hours in the afternoon sun, weeding the front yard without asking for water if it meant that his Aunt would spare him a small smile and a ‘good job’ by the time he was done. But never once did she ever spare him that little bit of love, that little bit of affection, that little bit of her time. Eventually, Harry learned to give up, keep his mouth shut, and pretend like he didn’t exist.────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────On Friday morning, Harry was astonished to see Uncle Vernon march into the kitchen, face red as a tomato, steam blowing out from his ears like a volcano ready to explode. Gathered in his arms were no less than  twelve  letters, all made with the same yellowing parchment and stamped with the same wax seal. His Uncle crumpled the letters with a crazed yell, startling  both  Aunt Petunia  and Harry. Uncle Vernon had nailed up the letter-box the day before with a triumphant laugh, saying: “If they  can’t deliver them, they’ll just give up.” He had seemed pretty confident about it, which explained why he was so angry about getting thwarted— apparently, the letters had been stuffed under the door, slotted through the sides, and two had even been forced into the small window in the downstairs toilet. Before Dudley could come downstairs, see the letters, and demand to read them, Uncle Vernon had already brought out the ceramic plate— which now had a couple burn marks— dumped all twelve letters on it, and lit them on fire. Harry, not wanting to get yelled at for staring, turned back to his bacon, feeling alarmed when he smelled something burning. It took him three seconds to figure out it was his letters, and not the bacon, so he forced himself to look at the pan and not to turn around. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again that day, spending the whole afternoon boarding up the cracks around the front and back door, as well as the window in the toilet. Harry wanted to point out that the toilet already had poor ventilation as it was, and that it would smell worse if the window was blocked up— but he thought better of it and refrained himself. On Saturday, things started to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters managed to get into the house, rolled up in the two dozen eggs that the bewildered milkman handed to Aunt Petunia through the living room window. Uncle Vernon was on the telephone for at least an hour, yelling and demanding explanations from the post office and the dairy— Harry was sure that the phone number of Number Four, Privet Drive, would get blocked from both of those places very soon. Meanwhile, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food mixer, glaring at it so hard that Harry thought she wanted to set fire to the parchment. “Who on Earth wants to talk to  you this badly?” Dudley said to Harry in amazement, as if he couldn’t believe that there was anything interesting enough about Harry to warrant a conversation. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon plopped down on the kitchen chair (Harry heard it creak and estimated that it would only be two more months before it collapsed), looking rather tired and ill but happy. “No post on Sundays!” He reminded them happily, not noticing that he was applying marmalade on his newspaper and not his toast, “No damn letters today—” There came the sound of something whizzing down the kitchen chimney, and before anyone could blink or tell Uncle Vernon he was spreading marmalade on his newspaper, a letter shot and caught Uncle Vernon sharply on the back of his head. In the next moment, thirty or forty letters zipped down and came pelting out like bullets, hitting anyone who wasn’t sensible enough to duck. Uncle Vernon seized Harry by the waist, lifting him up as if he were nothing more than a sack of leafy vegetables, hurtling him out into the hall. Harry hissed in pain as his spine collided with the floor— his back aches were just starting to ease up after he started sleeping in Dudley’s old bed. Aunt Petunia and Dudley rushed out of the kitchen after him, with the woman wrapping her hands around her son’s head to protect him. Uncle Vernon followed them and slammed the kitchen door shut. Everyone stood (or in Harry’s case, sat) in the hallway for a moment, listening to the continuous sound of letters pelting the kitchen walls. “That does it,” Uncle Vernon breathed heavily, like a bull about to charge into a fight, pulling out bunches of his moustache as he spoke. “I want you all back here in five minutes, ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!” He looked so dangerous with pieces of his moustache missing that no one dared to argue. They all marched upstairs, Petunia to hers and Vernon’s room, Dudley to his second bedroom, and Harry to  the smallest bedroom . Ten minutes later, they had wrenched themselves through the boarded door and were in the car, speeding towards the motorway. Sitting beside Harry in the back of the car was a sniffling Dudley, who had gotten hit round the head by his father when he held them up by trying to pack his television, computer, and video games into his sports bag. A few minutes ago, before they had entered the motorway, Dudley had wailed about a few of his television programs being on that afternoon, but had shut up quickly when Uncle Vernon raised his voice (Harry flinched) and snapped at him. They drove. And they drove. They drove for another hour, but Uncle Vernon still went on, so they drove on. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every once in a while, Uncle Vernon would make a sharp turn, and they would drive in the opposite direction for a while. Harry sighed and leaned against the window, wondering if his Uncle’s sudden urge to drive cross-country would be for the better or the worse. They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling; He had never had such a bad day in his life— he was hungry, he had missed five television programs, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel in the outskirts of a big city. They checked in hurriedly, with Aunt Petunia shepherding the two boys (Dudley was still wailing and causing a scene, so the Dursleys probably wanted to get out of the public eye as fast as possible). Dudley and Harry ended up sharing a room with two single beds that had musty sheets and dots of mould at the edges. The wailing must’ve tired Dudley out, for he was snoring in a minute and a half. Harry, on the other hand, was seated by the window sill, entranced by the cars driving to and fro. His letters still lingered at the back of his mind, but he tried not to feel too upset. Instead, he thought about what he was going to do when he grew up. Perhaps once he turned sixteen, Aunt Petunia would allow Harry to get a part-time job at a restaurant or someplace like that. Harry would then create a bank account for himself and save up money until he had enough. Then once he was eighteen, he would be free. To be frank, he had no doubt that the Dursleys intended to kick him out once he was of age, so he would like to be prepared and have some money on hand before he was thrown into the streets. Breakfast the next day was stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast, which Harry felt was a nice change from greasy bacon and scrambled eggs. They had just finished— Harry had a rather good portion and was already beginning to feel as though the impromptu road-trip wasn’t too bad— when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. “‘Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H. Potter? Only I got a ‘undred of these at the front desk.” The lady held up a letter for them to see. Printed on the front of yellowing parchment were the following: 
 Mr H. Potter, Room 17, Railview Hotel, Cokeworth  
“That’s me.” Harry said quietly. Uncle Vernon, rather rudely, snatched the letter from the lady, who stared at him for a moment. “I’ll take them.” He gritted out, nearly causing his chair to topple over when he stood.────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia voiced timidly, a few hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her at all. They had been driving for most of the day, and had only lurched to a stop a few times. The first time, Uncle Vernon had driven them into the depths of a forest, got out, shook his head, got back in the car, and started driving again. At that point, there wasn’t even a  road for them to be on. Harry briefly wondered if it was considered a road-trip if they weren’t on a road. Uncle Vernon stopped a couple other times, once in the middle of a ploughed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and once more at the rooftop of a multi-level carpark. Harry wasn’t complaining, though. That was the first time he’d gone sight-seeing in his entire life, and while the circumstances weren’t exactly ideal, he didn’t mind the exposure to the world outside Privet Drive. “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked his mother, looking glum. Harry, on the other hand, was having the time of his  life.  Uncle Vernon had parked them by the coast. Harry had never really seen the ocean before, and  no , it did not count to see the ocean through the living room telly. The cobalt-blue waves soothed him, even though he couldn’t really hear them properly. If Uncle Vernon hadn’t locked them all in the car, Harry might’ve risked asking his Aunt for permission to go outside and stand for a while. It started to rain, which made Harry all the more delighted. The patter-patter of raindrops always soothed him, and they often helped lull him to sleep. Dudley, on Harry’s left, snivelled. “It’s Monday,” he told his mother, “The Great Humberto’s on  tonight  . I want to stay somewhere with  television .” Monday, Harry hummed in his mind, rolling the word around absent-mindedly. If it  was Monday— and you could always count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television— then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never much fun. Last year, the Dursleys gave him a coat hanger, and the year before, they gave him one of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Soon, Uncle Vernon was back, and smiling as if he’d just won a lottery. He was also carrying a very long, thin package, and did not answer Aunt Petunia when she asked him what he had bought. “Found the perfect place!” he said merrily, “Come on! Everyone out!” Neither Aunt Petunia nor Dudley seemed very keen to step out into the raging winds around them, but they complied nonetheless. Harry, on the contrary, was delighted about this. The storm danced around him, tousling his hair to an even messier state. Not too far away, the ocean roared, crashing up onto the shores, the bubbly foam looking like a giant dragon’s claw, digging into the damp black of the beach. There was a distinct smell of salt in the air, and Harry tried to take in as much of it as possible. Who knew the next time he’d be allowed to breathe in the scent of the ocean? Uncle Vernon pointed at a large rock out at sea— it looked like a tiny black island, from where they were standing. Perched out on the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. Harry didn’t really mind staying there for the night— sure, it looked like it would be cold, damp and mouldy in there— but it was better than spending his birthday in the cupboard under the stairs. From the disdainful look on Dudley’s face, however, he was  much less happy about the shack. One thing was sure: It definitely did not have a television. “Storm forecast for tonight,” Uncle Vernon said gleefully, rubbing his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowing boat bobbing in the waters below them. Harry thought that the man looked rather like a genderbent version of the evil queen from Snow White’s tale, but the thought sounded rude, so he brushed it away. “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “So all aboard!” It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks while a chilly wind whipped their faces. Harry, oddly, still didn’t seem to mind. His thin flannel shirt seemed to be keeping him warm, and hearing the wind howl was strangely pleasing. It darted around him, like an airborne dragon sweeping its long, thin body in circles around and around the boat. Fear didn’t penetrate his blood but  awe did, filling him up with a giddiness he didn’t dare show (just in case Uncle Vernon was feeling particularly mean and decided to slap him for feeling happy). After what seemed like only a couple minutes (Harry sadly wished that the boat ride had lasted a little longer), they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down shack. The inside was damp and musty, reeking of seaweed. At least that’s what Harry assumed, he wasn’t very sure on what seaweed smelled like. Wind whistled through the cracks in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was wet, not having been used in at least half a dozen years. There were only two rooms, with the first being the living area, and the second being a walled-off bedroom. Uncle Vernon’s ‘rations’ turned out to be a packet of crisps each and four bananas. He set those on a rotting coffee table and happily tried to start a fire— and failed miserably, because empty crisp packets (Dudley devoured both his  and Harry’s portion in three minutes) were not very flammable and only created a lot of smoke and before shrivelling. “Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully, despite the fact everyone was  wet  and  cold . Well, mostly Aunt Petunia and Dudley— they were completely soaked through, and once Dudley had finished the distraction that was the crisps, he started shivering and complaining loudly. Aunt Petunia wasn’t that better off, as her teeth were clattering against each other while she hugged Dudley to keep them both warm. Much to his surprise, Harry was already more-or-less dry. His flannel was the thinnest piece of clothing among all of them, so he guessed that it didn’t retain a lot of water. He had warmed up considerably by the time Uncle Vernon gave up on starting a fire with potato crisp packets. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves rocketed off the exterior walls and a fierce wind rattled the windows, like a robber trying to break into the house. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had already retired into the other bedroom after digging out some mouldy blankets to make the couch comfortable for Dudley. Harry was left with the challenge of finding the softest bit of floor to lie on for the night, and once he did, he had to curl up to fit all of him under the thin, ragged blanket he was given. The storm raged more and more ferociously as time went on, and Harry lay awake, listening to the drums of thunder and wishing the windows were clean enough for him to see through.  The lightning must look spectacular, he thought,  especially with such a dark sky . Rain continued to pelt at the walls, so Harry focused on that, instead, and wondered if it would be painful if the rain was pelting against his skin. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was hanging over the side of the couch limply, told Harry that he had ten minutes until he was eleven. Harry amused himself with counting (mentally) down the seconds, synchronised with the watch. His birthday ticked nearer, nearer, and nearer…  Five minutes to go, Harry thought as he heard a creak from outside. He hoped the roof wouldn’t collapse— because if it did, he didn’t think there were any firefighters nearby, and even if there were, he didn’t think they’d happily jump onto a boat to a rocky island while a bloody storm raged on around them.  Four minutes.  Three minutes— was that the sound of the ocean beating onto the rocks? Harry furrowed his brow, because he had heard the crash of foam onto the jagged stones earlier, and he was certain that it didn’t go  thump,  thump,  thump. Oh, (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute until he was eleven, Harry lay awake and stared at the ceiling.  Thirty seconds… Twenty… Ten, nine…  Maybe he’d make a wish as the watch struck twelve. What should he wish for? Oh, his letter—  Three, two, one—  BOOM. The whole shack shook from taking the brunt of the force, and Harry sat up, wide awake, jolted out of his birthday wish. He stared at the door, his heart thrumming in his ears, louder than the thunder. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.There was  someone out there .  



Notes:

I'm still wrangling a lot with the plot and there's a lot of trips down the line... But as you can tell from the title, a whole lot of people adopt Harry. Hopefully, the plot will be able to convey that without feeling too trippy. Also, quick question as I really want to know the opinion of the people reading my fic: Do you want Harry to make it onto the quidditch team? Harry's in Slytherin, obviously, no big surprise because that's in the synopsis and the tags, and Slytherin already has a seeker (Terrence Higgs). In the original series, he was replaced by Draco in the next year, so I assume he was a seventh year and graduated. If I were to plop Harry into quidditch, I'd have to make a couple adjustments because 1. The original reason Harry becomes a seeker is because Malfoy takes Neville's rememberall. In this fic, Harry more-or-less becomes friends with Draco (Even though Harry does have a couple disagreements with his attitude), so I either have to make it Ron who takes the rememberall (And I honestly can't find a motive for that), or I could come up with another Gryffindor (We could make him like young James Potter in terms of personality), or I might plan an entirely new scenario for Snape to make Harry the seeker. I also have this dilemma where I kind of have to have a 'bad' student, since I took Malfoy out of that role. I don't particularly feel like making it Ron, because I have nothing against Gryffindors and there are a good number of them who 'adopt' Harry as well. A huge part of the original book is about Harry accepting Malfoy's challenge of a 'duel' (Which leads to the discovery of Fluffy), and since Harry and Malfoy are in the same house and Harry is much less likely, in this version of him, to accept, that's probably not going to happen. I do have an idea about what I want to do about that bit, though. Another subplot of the first book is smuggling out Norbert the dragon. I have no doubt that Harry would help Hagrid smuggle it out, simply because he cares enough about Hagrid. There's still a lot of fleshing out I need to do with the characters. Harry isn't the only who has changes (Becomes more quiet, sensible, and keeps his nose out of trouble— But will follow his own set of morals). Hermione plays a big role in the story, and she's more or less the same with the exception that her thirst for knowledge and ambition to become smart/make her parents proud puts her in Slytherin. Draco is still a bit of an arse, especially to Hermione at first, but Harry (Who is mostly passive— that's part of his character development) begins learning to stand up against others through defending her. Anyway, enough rambling. I hope you enjoyed the read! Let me know what you think :3

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────BOOM. Harry stared at the door, feeling absolutely terrified— who on Earth was behind the door— and how strong were they, to be able to cause a knock that rattled the foundations of the shack? Dudley jerked awake, looking around wildly. “Where’s the cannon?” He said, eyes still unaccustomed to the dark. There was a crash behind them, and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. The mystery of the long package he was carrying had been unveiled. It was a rifle, gleaming cruelly under the little light. The man looked rather terrifying, with his moustache still uneven and hair messed up from his sleep. If Harry had to put it in one word, his Uncle looked  feral . “Who’s there?” He shouted, actively trying to sound menacing. “I warn you— I’m armed!” There was a pause, in which everyone held their breaths, gazes stuck to the door like iron to magnet. Then— SMASH! The door was hit with such a force that it swung cleanly off the hinges, and with a deafening crash, landed on the floor. Harry leapt up, his flight or fight instinct kicking in (never in his life had he ever chosen fight, mind you). Quickly, he ducked behind the couch, heart threatening to escape from his chest, threatening to run across the country and never come back. Harry’s curiosity still got the best of him, however, so he peered over the top of the couch, noticing how Dudley had turned pale with fear. A giant of a man was standing, imposingly, in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled mess of a moustache. Only his eyes could be made out, a pair of black beetles under all the hair. The giant pushed his way into the hut, stooping— but still, his head grazed the ceiling as he entered. He bent down, picked up the door, and easily fit it back into the door frame. The thundering sound of the storm quelled down a little, muffled by the walls. The giant patted and brushed his hands together, sounding satisfied with his work. Then, he turned and looked at them. “Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey…” He strode over to the couch, where Dudley sat, paralysed by fear. Harry wriggled back further, realising that he was no longer safe where he was— the giant could easily spot him by just turning to look at the back of the couch, and if Harry got up and ran for better refuge— well, he’d be spotted instantly. Trying not to make a sound, Harry stayed where he was, biting his lip and breathing as quietly as possible. “Budge up, yer great lump.” said the stranger, pointedly to Dudley. Dudley squeaked in response, darting away to hide behind his mother, who was crouched behind Uncle Vernon. The stranger scoffed as he watched Dudley go. In doing so, he twisted his great waist to look behind the couch. Which was where Harry was hiding. “Ah! An’ here’s Harry!” Harry felt his blood flow stop abruptly when the stranger called him by name. Taking a  giant  risk, he looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowed face, and found a pair of great, dark eyes. Now that he looked closer, they were almost a dark walnut brown. Most importantly, Harry found that the pair of eyes were crinkled into a  smile. “Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby.” said the giant, “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”  Uncle Vernon made a rasping noise, like he was choking on something and was trying to force it back  up into his mouth. “I demand that you leave at once, sir!” He said, looking very much like someone who  should not be demanding things of a giant almost twice his height. “You are breaking and entering!” “Ah, shut up, Dursley, you great prune,” said the giant with a roll of his eyes. He reached over the sofa (Harry ducked instinctively), snatched the rifle from Uncle Vernon’s trembling hands, and bent it into a knot (Harry thought it rather looked like a pretzel) as if it were made from rubber, and threw it in the corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse getting trodden on. “Anyway— Harry,” The giant smiled, turning his back away from the Dursleys, “A very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat for yeh here— I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste alright.” From the inside of his great overcoat, the giant tugged out a slightly squashed box. Harry, deciding that if the giant wanted to kill him, he would’ve already— took the box with shaky hands, counting  one-two, one-two  in his mind to reorganise his breathing. Slowly, Harry pried the box open. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with ‘  Happy Birthday Harry ’ written in green icing.  Thank you would’ve been the appropriate response, but the words died in Harry’s throat and the corpses sunk back into his lungs. Instead, he stared at the giant for a moment longer, and in his soft voice, asked: “Excuse me if I’m being rude, but… Who are you?” The giant chuckled. “True. I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” He held out a hand and shook Harry’s entire arm. “What about that tea then, eh?” He said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”Hagrid’s eyes fell on the damp fireplace, trailing over the empty crisp packets. A loud snort came from the man. Harry supposed that a big man had a big lung, and a big lung could result in a big snort. The giant leant over the fireplace, fiddled with it— or at least Harry assumed he fiddled with it, as his great back covered the whole area and they couldn’t see what he was doing. When he drew back, however, there was a great fire roaring in the fireplace, consuming the shrivelled crisp packets and everything else that the flames could reach. The whole room was graced with its flickering light, and Harry felt much more relaxed when the crackle of the fire droned on. The giant sat back down on the couch, which grunted and dipped under his weight, and started taking all sorts of things from the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, a few chipped mugs, and a bottle of amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon, the whole house was alive with sound and filled with the smell of sizzling sausages. Nobody said anything while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages off the poker, Dudley fidgeted. Uncle Vernon said sharply: “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” The giant chuckled darkly. “Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ any more, Dursley, don’ worry.” He passed the freshly-cooked sausages to Harry, who decided that if he was going to die via poisoning, he might as well do it while enjoying the food. A grumble came from his stomach— Harry had eaten nothing more than the  smallest  banana Uncle Vernon had, and now that he had smelt the sizzling sausages, he was  famished. Politely, Harry took the sausages with a soft ‘thank you’ and helped himself to it, humming appreciatively as he took in the chewiness. The entire sausage was gone within a minute (Harry mentally reminded himself not to gobble the whole thing up like a savage but instead pace his mouthfuls). Finally, as no one seemed about to explain anything, Harry opened his mouth again: “I’m sorry, but I still really don’t know who you are.” The giant took a heavy sip of his tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Call me Hagrid,” He said, “Everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m the Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts— yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, of course.” “Em… No.” Harry said, bowing his head down in embarrassment. Hagrid looked quite shocked, as his mouth dropped open into a wide ‘o’. “Sorry.” Harry said quickly, already starting to feel bad. He dipped his gaze downwards, choosing to stare at his (mismatched) socked feet. There was a heavy feeling pulling on the bottom of his ribcage, tugging him towards the damp Earth with an unknown force. “Sorry ?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank into the shadows, “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all?” “All what?” ssked Harry, instinctively shrinking into himself. He wished the giant would lower his voice a little— there was a part of Harry that wanted to flee, to run, to get away, but there was also a part of Harry that was  intrigued— the giant clearly knew something about his parents, and he was eager to hoard any scraps of information he could get. “ALL WHAT?” thundered Hagrid, “Now wait just one second!” He had leapt to his feet, vaulting over the couch easily. In his burst of anger, he seemed to fill the whole hut, towering over the cowering Dursleys. Harry, frightened by the loud voice, had ducked so that he was shorter than the couch, holding his arms in front of him to protect his face. Things were never certain— the giant could turn on him any moment, and the scruffy, small boy that was Harry Potter would never stand a chance against those fists. “Do you mean ter tell me,” The giant growled at the Dursleys, “That this boy— this boy!— knows nothin’ about— about ANYTHING?” Harry panicked, heart thrumming so loudly in his ears he was surprised to see that there wasn’t a drum right next to his head. The Dursleys were just as frightened— if not more— as him. Sure, he didn’t really  like  them, per say, but they gave him a roof to sleep under and enough food to get by— if the giant hurt them, or worse,  killed them, where would Harry go? He wasn’t sure that he wanted to be chucked into the orphanage or to be handed over the social services. Then again, if the giant killed the Dursleys, he was likely to kill Harry, too. “I know  some  things,” Harry said, at last, sounding timid even to his own ears. A burst of courage had swarmed up inside him, like a water balloon being popped. “I… I can… Do maths and stuff.” Moments after he opened his mouth, he realised exactly how  lame he sounded. Now all he wanted to do was to bury himself in the soil, hope that the waves eventually grew high enough to overtake the shack, and drown in the sea. Hagrid simply waved his hand and said: “About our world, I mean.  Your  world. My world.  Yer parents’ world .” Feeling rather stupid now, Harry stared. “What world?”Hagrid looked ready to explode. “DURSLEY!” He boomed, the volume shaking the shack from the very foundation. Aunt Petunia whimpered, torn between looking at Hagrid and at the ceiling, probably wondering if they would die by the hands of the giant or by the hands of the unstable hut. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something along the lines of ‘Mimblewimble’. Hagrid turned, his shaggy mane slapping the Dursleys in the face, and looked wildly at Harry. The expression he was wearing looked like it could belong in a serial killer’s mugshot. “But yer must know about yer mom and dad,” He said, “I mean, they’re  famous  .  You’re  famous.” “What?” At this point Harry was probably too ready to die, and therefore not bothering with holding back or filtering his speech anymore. “My— My mum and dad weren’t famous, were they?” “Yeh don’t know… yeh don’t know…” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair (And grunted when they got tangled), fixing his eyes on Harry with a bewildered stare, looking positively unhinged now. A deep breath made the windows rattle as the giant recollected himself, and finally said: “Yeh don’t know what yeh  are ?” Uncle Vernon finally found his voice. “Stop!” He commanded, and Harry looked at him like he was a man without a sense of self-preservation. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you from telling the boy anything!” A man less stupid than Vernon Dursley would’ve known to keep his mouth shut, as Hagrid was now giving him a furious look, and if looks could kill, well… Vernon Dursley would be no more. When Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. Uncle Vernon would’ve been better off with his thoughts to himself. “You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” Very quietly, Harry spoke, looking into the giant’s eyes with his emerald-green orbs. “Keep  what from me?” “STOP!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic (it was at this moment Harry decided that his Uncle either had a death wish, or had no survival skills at all). “I FORBID YOU!” Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror, her bony hands clinging onto her husband’s arm while she pushed Dudley behind them. “Ah, go boil your heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid disdainfully. “Harry— Yer a wizard.” There was silence inside the hut. As silent as it could be, anyway, with the storm still howling, the waves still crashing, and the wind still shrieking. “I’m a  what  ?” Harry said, as calmly as a ten— no,  eleven-year-olds could be when their entire understanding of the universe was just demolished like old buildings before their eyes. “A wizard, o’ course.” Hagrid replied, sitting down on the couch, which groaned and sagged even lower— it was only ten centimeters from the ground now. “An’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it's ‘bout time yer read yer letter.” Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowing parchment from Hagrid, wonder colouring in his eyes as he finally stood, safely in possession of the letter addressed to  Mr H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-On-The-Rock, The Sea , in emerald green ink. He pulled out the letter and started reading. ━━━━━━━HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRYHeadmaster: Albus Dumbledore(Order of merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc. Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)Dear Mr Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. Yours sincerely, 
 Minerva McGonagall 
Deputy Headmistress ━━━━━━━Questions erupted inside Harry’s brain like fireworks on Bonfire Night, and he couldn’t decide which one he wanted to ask first. They were popping up left and right as he read line after line, similar to bubbles surfacing in a pot of frothing, boiling water. After a few minutes, Harry decided to go with the question which he wanted an answer to the most. “What does it mean, they await my owl?” Harry asked, big, curious eyes looking up at Hagrid. Fear was no longer present in his gaze. If the man in front of him knew his parents, and had come so far to give him the letter that he wanted, then he was no threat. …  Okay, technically it was possible that Hagrid was still trying to kidnap him and that the whole thing was just an act, but Harry was going to ignore that in favour of the fact he had  finally  gotten his hands on  his letter . “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a horse (Harry, after hearing the loud  slap , looked very concerned for a second or two). From another pocket inside his overcoat, Hagrid pulled out an owl. A real, live, rather ruffled-looking, disgruntled owl (Harry supposed that no living thing would feel happy about living in a coat of a great giant). A long quill and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth, Hagrid scribbled a note which Harry managed to read upside down. ‘Dear Mr Dumbledore, given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.'  While Hagrid penned his note, the owl had hopped from his clothed hand onto the couch, peering at Harry curiously. Equally curiously, Harry watched in amazement as the bird hooted softly at him, and with a steady hand, the boy reached out and smoothed out the tawny’s feathers. Seeming to like that, the owl leant into his hand and cooed even more, sounding like an affectionate cat (with wings!) to Harry. Hagrid, who had finished, rolled up the note and gave it to the owl. The tawny clamped the note between her (his?) beak unhappily, jumping back onto the giant’s arm. Crossing the hut in two large steps, Hagrid yanked the door open and yeeted the owl into the storm before Harry could protest. Then he came back and resumed his previous spot at the couch as if the whole ordeal had just been as ordinary as answering the phone. “Is… Is the owl going to be alright?” Harry asked, worry tugging at his heart when he thought of the poor thing braving through the storm. “Oh, they’re used to it.” Hagrid said with a chuckle, “Now, where was I?” At that moment, Uncle Vernon, who was ashen-faced but still looking very much like an angry tomato, moved into the firelight. The orange glow lit up his face in the same way that flashlights lit up the faces of people telling a horror story on a camping trip, and for a moment, Uncle Vernon, in his uneven-moustache glory, looked pretty menacing. “He’s not going.” Uncle Vernon stomped his foot, signalling that his word was final, that no arguments would be tolerated. Dudley didn’t receive that kind of tone often, so when Uncle Vernon used it, he meant business. Hagrid grunted. Maybe it was a laugh, but Harry couldn’t really hear the giant properly from under all his hair. “I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him.” He said. “In case yer didn’t know, Harry, ‘Muggle’ is what we call non-magic folk like them. An’ it’s yer bad luck that you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, ignoring the latter part of what Hagrid said, even though Harry could’ve sworn he saw his Uncle’s eyes twitch. “Swore we’d stamp it out of it. Wizard, indeed!” “You  knew  ?” Harry said quietly, his heart still drumming in his chest, banging on his rib cages. “You  knew I’m a— a wizard?” The eleven-year-old boy was still wrapping his head around the whole ‘wizard’ business, but he didn’t need to understand it to feel upset about the fact his Aunt and Uncle had withheld it from him. “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly, making everyone remember that she was still in the room. Her eyes were wide and livid, the trachea underneath her long neck becoming more pronounced than it normally was when she raised her voice. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, with my  dratted  sister being what she was?” Scorn laced her voice like the overly-fancy tablecloths Aunt Petunia had back at Privet Drive. “Oh, she got a letter just like that.” She glared at the yellowy parchment in Harry’s hand, “And  disappeared  to that— that  school— and came home every holiday with her pockets full of  frog-spawn, turning  teacups  into  rats! I was the only one who saw her for what she was—” Aunt Petunia inhaled a crazed breath, “A  freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily  this  and Lily  that, they were  proud of having a witch in the family!” She stopped to take a deep breath and went ranting on. It seemed like all that emotion had been weighing her for her whole life, and she had wanted to speak her mind for  years . “Then she met Potter at that school and they left and got  married  and had  you  , and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as— as— as  abnormal— and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!” Harry could feel the blood drain away from his skin, as all the warmth he had been feeling that night disappeared, erased from existence. His toes felt cold, his skin felt clammy, there was a stone in his stomach, and his intestines were tied tangled in a knot. “Blown… Blown up.” He murmured, slowly, softly, carefully, handling the words as if they were pieces of priceless china. The spiralling, endless emerald universe in his eyes had faded, giving way to a dull, lifeless green. “You told me they died in a car crash.” He said quietly just as he felt his eyes begin to water uncontrollably. “CAR CRASH?” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys all scuttled back into their corner. “How could a  car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!” “Then what happened?” Hastily, Harry wiped his tears away on his sleeve. Crying never did him any good, and if anything, it was a sign of weakness, a soft spot for the Dursleys to prod at. The anger faded away from Hagrid’s face, retreating as quickly as the water line before a tsunami. It was replaced with anxiety, as the great giant suddenly looked unsure and slightly uncomfortable. “I never expected this,” He said in a low, worried voice, “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ a hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’t know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh— but someone’s gotta— yeh can’t go off to Hogwarts not knowin’.” He threw one more dirty look at the Dursleys for good measure. “Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh— mind, I can’t tell yeh everything, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it…” Hagrid heaved a big sigh, sitting down and staring at the fire for a few seconds. “It begins, I suppose, with— with a person called— but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows—” “Who?” asked Harry softly. “Well— I don’t like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.” Harry let the silence seep for a moment. “... Why?” “Gulpin’ Gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was a wizard who went… Bad. As bad as you can go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was…” Hagrid gulped, opening his mouth (well, Harry couldn’t  see  his mouth, so he didn’t  see if it was open, but the giant’s jaw moved, so Harry assumed that his mouth was open)— but no words came out. “Could you perhaps write it down?” Harry suggested quietly, an obvious lack of emotion in his voice. His mind was, however, raging, wilder and fiercer than a storm in the open sea. Big waves crashed against each other in the midst of all the turmoil. Ships were tossed around like rag dolls, completely defenceless against the crushing grip of the sea. “Nah— can’t spell it. Alright—  Voldermort .” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’t make me say it again. Anyway, this— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer more followers. Got ‘em, too— some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, alright. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange witches or wizards… Terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. Course, some stood up to him— an’ he killed ‘em. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare taking the school, not jus’ then, anyway.” Harry nodded, rapt with attention. “Now yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head Boy an’ Girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before… Probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.” Hagrid paused before continuing, “Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em… Maybe he just wanted ‘em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Hallowe’en ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’— an’—” Rather abruptly, Hagrid pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with the sound of a large cruise ship departing from port. “Sorry,” He said, “But it’s that sad— knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find— anyway— You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then— an’ then this is the real myst’ry of the thing— he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh— took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even— but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age— the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts— an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind, as he winced and tensed in an effort to not make a sound. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he again saw a blinding flash of green light, just like the ones that always plagued his dreams and forced him to wake, sweating profusely. This time, however, it was clearer than he remembered, and for the first time ever, a high, cold, cruel laugh accompanied the flash. When Harry managed to force his eyes open— they had uncontrollably closed when he was relieving that green-flash-nightmare— he saw that Hagrid was watching him sadly. “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot…” Hagrid almost looked apologetic as he said this. “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped— he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage (he never learned, did he?). He had somehow gathered the audacity to glare at Hagrid, fists clenched, as if he was ready to throw a punch or two (he would only be able to reach Hagrid’s lower chest at most, the giant was almost twice of Harry’s Uncle’s height). “Now you listen here, boy,” Uncle Vernon snarled. “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured—” (Harry shrunk into himself at the word ‘beating’), “And as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion— asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizardy types— just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end—” At that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat, brandishing it like a sword. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon, he said: “I’m warning you, Dursley— I’m warning you— one more word…” In light of the danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s newly-found courage receded again. He flattened himself against the wall (as much as he could, anyway, as his belly wasn’t helping the case) and fell silent. “That’s better.” said Hagrid, his breaths coming out in big puffs, like those of a great dane’s after it had just run a couple miles. The couch wailed in pain as the giant sat down once more, this time finally sagging onto the floor. Harry, who had processed what Hagrid told him, still had some follow-up questions he wanted answers to. Neither his Aunt nor Uncle answered any questions he had about his parents and his past, so Harry was planning on taking full advantage of Hagrid while he was around. “But what… What happened to Vol— Sorry,” Harry added hurriedly when he noticed how Hagrid flinched at the name. He made note to never address the dark wizard by his name in front of the giant— He knew, first-hand, that some words could trigger certain… Reactions, and send some people spiralling downwards, and would hate to be the person that made Hagrid feel that way, especially since Hagrid had been so kind to him since he first arrived. “I mean, You-Know-Who? What happened to You-Know-Who?” “Good question, Harry.” Hagrid nodded his approval. “Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see… He was gettin’ more an’ more powerful— why’d he go?” Harry knew enough about rhetorical sentences to not say a thing and waited for the giant to continue. “Some say he died.” The giant shook his head, “Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’t believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em came outta kinda trances. Don’t reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.” Hagrid took a deep breath before going on. “Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ‘Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on—  I dunno what it was, no one does— But somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure that there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He was just little Harry Potter, thin and scrawny, the one all the bullies picked on. He’d spent his life being hunted by Dudley, being bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. If he was  really  a  wizard  — why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they tried (and succeeded) to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer (Harry assumed Voldermort  was the greatest sorcerer— he had sounded pretty powerful in Hagrid’s retellings), how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? “Hagrid,” He said quietly, fidgeting with his fingers instead of looking at the giant, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. “Not a wizard, eh?” The black beetle eyes of Hagrid twinkled playfully. “Never made things happen when you was scared, or angry?” The tone of the giant implied that he was very, very  sure that he was right, and as Harry thought about it… Harry looked into the fire, his mind beginning to wander. Perhaps he was just slapping on an excuse onto the odd things that had happened to him, but for one moment, a part of him just wanted everything to be true. Whenever he was terrified about Dudley’s gang chasing him, he would somehow find himself out of their reach, somehow crossing more than half the park in two steps… And when he had been dreading going to school with a ridiculous haircut (The one where Aunt Petunia shaved him bald with the exception of his fringe, which was to cover his scar), he’d managed to grow it back overnight… And when he had felt upset about the boa constrictor never going to Brazil— A slow smile slipped onto Harry’s face, and he looked up to see Hagrid positively beaming (At least Harry thought he was beaming under the beard) at him. “See?” Said Hagrid triumphantly. “Harry Potter, not a wizard—” Hagrid scoffed at that. “You wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” Uncle Vernon wasn’t giving in without a fight, however. “Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” He hissed, glaring beadily at Hagrid. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish— Spell books and wands and—” “If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” Growled Hagrid, growing in size once more. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest Headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—”“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” Yelled Uncle Vernon. Jumping and ducking by the sense of self-preservation programmed into his cells, Harry dipped so that he was lower than the couch. Bad things always happened when adults started yelling at each other, and if the adults couldn’t take out their anger on each other— They’d take it out on  Harry . It had happened before, when Uncle Vernon had a potential partner over at the house and ended up arguing over a disagreement. There had been raised voices and raised hands, and in all the noise and panic, Harry tripped over himself and spilled coffee all over the floor. Both men had laid hands on him that night, and Harry had felt the soreness and sting for weeks after that. “NEVER— INSULT— ALBUS— DUMBLEDORE— IN FRONT— OF— ME!” Thundered Hagrid, eyes ablaze with fury. He waved his umbrella and waved it over his head. Even though the object was a lovely, faded pink, the giant still looked very menacing with it. The umbrella came swishing through the air, down until it was pointed at Dudley (Who had stolen away Harry's birthday cake and was stuffing his face with it)— There was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, and a sharp squeal. Harry dared to peek, raising a little from his hiding spot behind the couch. Dudley was howling in pain, his hands clasped over his bottom. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his striped blue and white trousers. Uncle Vernon roared, his face ranging from a ghostly white to a tomato red. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Distantly, through the thin walls, they could hear Aunt Petunia wailing about her ‘poor, ickle Dudleykins’ while the distinct, whiny howls of Dudley’s soared above everything else. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard, wincing when he pulled on a few tangles. “Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” He said ruefully, “But it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left to do.” He cast a sideways look at Harry, who was now kneeling on the floor, prepared to duck for cover if the need arose. “Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” Hagrid said, looking like a guilty child who stole candy from the pantry, “I’m— Er— Not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff— One o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job—” “Why… Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” Harry asked, peering curiously at Hagrid through a frame of plastic and sellotape. “Oh, well— I was at Hogwarts meself but I— Er— Got expelled ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.” Explained Hagrid. Harry supposed he knew why the giant had reacted so violently to Uncle Vernon tarnishing Dumbledore's name now. “Oh.” Harry said quietly, wondering if the rules at Hogwarts were strict— If  he got expelled, he’d be so embarrassed he’d never look anyone in the eye ever again. “Can I ask why?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” Said Hagrid loudly. Harry accepted the avoidance of his question and didn’t push further— Clearly, it wasn’t something Hagrid wanted to talk about and Harry didn’t blame him. Besides, it was rather personal and Harry admitted that he thought he’d crossed some lines.“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry, who nearly fell over under the weight of the big thing. Strangely, it didn’t smell as bad as Harry thought it would be— Hell, the basin of rags that Aunt Petunia was dyeing for him smelled worse than the coat. Instead, the coat smelt like pine, undergrowth, and a plethora of miscellaneous items that Harry couldn’t exactly discern. “You can kip under that,” Hagrid said with a warm smile. Harry’s heart skipped a beat when he realised that Hagrid had noticed the thin blanket Harry was using to cover himself, and had been thoughtful enough to offer him something warmer. “Don’t mind if it wriggles a bit. I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.” Harry settled down on the couch, lying down next to a giant that could easily crush him with one hand— And yet, he slept soundly, feeling the safest he’d ever been since he was one. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────



Notes:

Soooooo what do you think about Harry's behaviour and personality? I'm pretty interested to know what you guys think about him. How do you think his personality and more passive behaviour will affect his relationship with Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Snape? hit me up on tumblr @nxrthmizu or on twitter (although I'm less active there) as @nxrthmizuOh, and one more thing— To everyone who commented on the last chapter, thank you so much! I really enjoyed reading your comments and all the contributions gave me lots of ideas about future chapters. Thank you so much for reading my new word vomit <3







Chapter 4: The World Beyond Privet Drive


Notes:
Sorry for the delay! I've been busy with work lately T_T This chapter was supposed to be part of a longer & bigger chapter called 'Diagon Alley', but I realised that Diagon Alley was becoming a really bloody long chapter (which is part of the reason why I'm not done with it yet), so I cut off this part from Diagon Alley and you get a chapter this week! Yay! Enjoy :D

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)




Chapter Text
Harry woke up early the next morning. Daylight streamed through the windows, acting as a strobe light for the dance party that the dust particles above him were holding. Despite that, he kept his eyes firmly shut,  insistent about living inside his dream for a few minutes more.  It was just a dream  , He told himself logically,  I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I’m going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes, I’ll be at home, under my cupboard.  There was a loud tapping noise.  And there’s Aunt Petunia  , He thought glumly, his heart sinking.  Knocking on the door, telling me to get up and make breakfast and scrub greasy pans. He still didn’t open his eyes, though— it had been such a nice dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. “Alright,” said Harry, rubbing his eyes. “I’m getting up.” He sat up with a bit of trouble and quickly discovered why. Hagrid’s heavy, lumpy coat was over him and sled off onto the ground. The storm was over, and light flooded into the room through the translucent windows (they were supposed to be transparent but were so marred with dust and lizard faeces that Harry couldn’t see through them). Hagrid was still asleep, sitting upright at the foot of the couch, snoring soundly. The tapping sound hadn’t been Aunt Petunia at all— it was an owl, tapping at the window with an annoyed expression, and if it didn’t have a newspaper in its beak, Harry was sure it would’ve hooted angrily at him. Harry scrambled to his feet, feeling so happy that it was like a large balloon was swelling up inside of him. He unlatched the window, eyes trailing after the pretty owl in awe as it swooped over him and dropped the newspaper in Hagrid’s lap. Making a displeased noise, the owl started attacking Hagrid’s coat, which Harry had left on the couch. “Please stop that,” Harry said softly, reaching out with his hands, palms open wide, hoping he could calm the angry bird. “D-Don’t do that.”The owl, who had feathers in a pretty light brown colour— the same colour as the coats that young adults wore those days— tilted its head at him, big, round eyes studying Harry curiously. It cooed and stopped pecking the coat, taking a step forward with one of its adorable little claws to inspect the scruffy boy some more. “You’re so pretty,” Harry breathed, inching his hand forward, making sure the owl could see his movements. “May I pet you?” The owl made a rumbling sound and blinked happily as it hopped forward, letting Harry stroke and smoothen out the ruffles the wind had caused among its feathers. Harry felt his heart warm when the animal sided up into him, rubbing its head on his chest, quite like the way cats brushed their tails along their owners’ legs to display affection. “You’re such a pretty little thing,” Said Harry, still amazed. The feathers of the owl felt soft and delicate to his touch, so he took care not to accidentally tug on them when he ran his fingers along the bird’s back. “So pretty and majestic at the same time.” Apparently, owls loved being complimented— or at least this one did— because it snuggled up closer to him and made little chirpy noises, hooting in complaint when Harry stopped petting it. “Hagrid,” Harry said at last, feeling like the giant would know what to do as he was sure the owl wasn’t supposed to stay at the shack for the whole day, “There’s an owl—” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted as he shifted, tucking his face into his neck. “What?” said Harry, distracted by smoothing out a fray in the owl’s feathers.  “He wants payin’ for deliverin’ the papers,” Hagrid said, shifting again, “Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing  but  pockets, and Harry didn’t feel like asking the giant to specify  which pocket. Hagrid seemed rather tired and Harry didn’t reckon he’d be all too pleased to get woken up This left him to dig through pocket after pocket, hoping that the next one would be it. The owl decided to perch on Harry’s shoulder, which hurt a bit because of how sharp its talons were, but he liked the weight of the bird so he didn’t brush it away. After pulling out bunches of keys, dark-coloured pellets, balls of string, a half-finished knitting project and its needles, mint-humbugs and teabags, Harry  finally found a bunch of strange-looking coins. The owl cooed its approval, recognising the currency even though Harry didn’t. “Give him five knuts.” Said Hagrid sleepily. “Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Obediently, Harry counted five and placed them in the leather pouch tied to the left talon of the owl. The bird cooed and coddled his cheek once more before soaring out the open window. Harry felt his heart sink a little at seeing it go. He liked the bird, and he wished it stayed a little longer. Hagrid yawned loudly, righting his back (there was an audible  crack , which made a look of horror and concern wash over Harry’s face, but the giant paid it no mind) before standing up to stretch. “Best be off, Harry. Lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy yer stuff fer school.” Harry was inspecting the coins, letting them roll all over his hand and finding satisfaction in the  clink-clink-clink of the currency. The amusement didn’t last long, however, as he had thought of something that made him feel as though someone had popped the happy balloon inside him with a needle. The air whizzed out comically and Harry deflated a little. “Um… Hagrid?” said Harry, looking a bit down now. “Mm?” The giant, who was pulling on his huge boots, hummed in reply. “I… I haven’t got any money,” Harry said, shifting from foot to foot miserably. “And you— You heard Uncle Vernon last night— He won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry ‘bout that,” Hagrid grinned, scratching his head absent-mindedly. “Dyeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” “But if their house was destroyed—” “They didn’t keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold— an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, either.” Hagrid had put on his coat, and out of one of the  many pockets, had pulled out a string of the sausages he cooked the previous night, offering one to Harry, who took it gratefully. “Wizards have banks?” Harry said, wide-eyed as he took a bite from his sausage. His toothbrush and other hygiene products were inside Aunt Petunia’s bag, which were inside the other room. While he felt a little disgusted at the thought of not brushing in the morning, he didn’t think that Aunt Petunia would be particularly happy to fetch his cleaning things for him, not after what happened the previous night. “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” Harry nearly dropped the bit of sausage he was holding, but caught it thanks to his quick reflexes. “ Goblins ?” He said, eyes wide-open with revelation. “Yeah— so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe— ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter of fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you— gettin’ things from Gringotts— knows he can trust me, see.” Harry nodded, filing away all the information for future reference. “Got everythin’? Come on, then.” Hagrid said merrily, leading the way to the door. Unsurely, Harry looked back at the door of the other room. His relatives had no trouble leaving him with a stranger the previous night, so they  definitely wouldn’t have any problems with him up-and-going with the giant man. In fact, they’d probably pray that Hagrid wouldn’t bring him back. Despite that, however, the Dursleys were his only family, and even though they’d ridiculed, neglected, and beat him, they had still given him a roof over his head. Hagrid gave him an expectant look, as if he couldn’t understand why Harry was hesitating. The boy shook his head and followed the giant out the door, hoping he wasn’t making the wrong decision. Then again, even if he didn’t want to go, Hagrid was more than capable of  making him go, either by using magic or by dragging him with sheer force (or just picking Harry up like he weighed less than a puppy dog). The sky was quite clear now, a sharp contrast from the roaring winds of the night before. Harry had loved the storm, but the gleaming, bright blue sea was a nice scenery, too. Somewhere above, seagulls squawked, spreading their pure white wings to glide on the wind on their return trip to their nests, hidden somewhere among the cliffs on the shore. The wind was much more playful, dancing around Harry’s dark locks and ruffling his hair. A salty scent decorated the air, a mark of the sea’s presence as little foamy fingers dashed up against the rock. The boat Uncle Vernon hired was still there, docked on the shore, filled with water from the storm. Hagrid easily tilted it to the side to pour away the seawater. “How did you get here?” Harry asked curiously, moving agilely down the rock to keep up with Hagrid. It hadn’t occurred to the giant that not everyone had strides as big as his. The eleven-year-old had looked around when he first came out of the hut, and he didn’t see any other boat or vessel. Did Hagrid swim to the rock? The answer was much more baffling than the swimming option. “Flew,” said Hagrid simply, as if he were saying the sky is blue. “ Flew ?” “Yeah— But we’ll go back in this. Now s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.” Hagrid plopped down on the boat, which sunk a few inches lower under his weight. Harry sincerely hoped that he remembered the little bit of swimming he picked up from a compulsory class in primary school. They settled into the boat, Harry distracting himself from the possibility of the boat sinking by staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. Would he be upright, like Mary Poppins, with his pink umbrella, hanging onto the handle as the wind carried him around? Or was he more like superman, holding one fist forward with the other hand drawn back to his waist as he zoomed forward horizontally? Either way, it was an interesting image to think about. “Seems a shame to row, though,” said Hagrid, snapping Harry out of his mental image of Hagrid-slash-Superman. The giant was giving him another one of his sideways looks. “If I was ter— er— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Promise.” Harry said firmly. He had never broken a promise before, and he didn’t intend to start now. Besides, there was a teensy weensy part of him that was excited to see more magic. The world—  his world— Was beginning to unfold right before his eyes. The world beyond Privet Drive was beginning to blossom before him, and while the sensible part of him reminded him not to expect the whole business to last for very long, he still wanted to enjoy himself before it ended. Hagrid grinned widely, tapping his pink umbrella twice on the side of the boat. As if a machine had suddenly appeared behind the boat, they were propelled towards the direction of the shore, the boat whizzing and riding the waves like a speedboat. A laugh slipped from Harry’s mouth as the sea sprayed against his face, a cooling air drifting in and out of his flannel. He had never felt so exhilarated in his entire life. Once he got used to the speed, Harry calmed down a little and thought about the questions he had wanted to ask Hagrid. “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” He said. “Spells— enchantments,” Said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way— Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ to get out, even if yeh did manage to get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the  Daily Prophet . Harry had learnt from Uncle Vernon (and Dudley, who was the one disturbing Uncle Vernon) that people liked to be left alone as they read. However, it was very difficult, as he was bursting at the seams with questions and had finally found someone who wouldn’t (like Aunt Petunia) snap at him for asking questions.  “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual.” muttered Hagrid, turning the page. “There’s a  Ministry of Magic ?” Harry couldn’t resist asking, eyes alight with curiosity. “Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” Now, Harry didn’t know a whole lot about politics. The only bits and pieces he knew were from Uncle Vernon’s occasional biased tirades whenever there was something in the paper about the government, but a minister writing letters to a headmaster  constantly asking for advice sounded like a pretty pathetic minister to Harry. “But what does the Ministry of Magic  do ?” Harry asked, sensing that Hagrid wasn’t all too annoyed by his first question. “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up and down the country,” Hagrid explained patiently. “Why?” “ Why ?” Hagrid looked at Harry as if he had grown two heads. “Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment the boat bumped gently onto the harbour wall, as if it was the boat’s gentle way of telling them they’d arrived. It reminded Harry of how Aunt Petunia gently shook Dudley awake the night before when they’d reached Railview Hotel. The sudden spring-up of his Aunt reminded Harry of something very important. “Hagrid,” Harry started, sounding a little timid. “My… My Aunt and Uncle and Dudley are still on the island, and… And we used their boat.”  They’re stuck on the rock , Harry wanted to say, but instead opened and closed his mouth like a goldfish out of water as he stood under Hagrid’s scrutinising gaze. The giant chuckled and patted him on the back. “Yer inherited yer mother’s kindness, eh?” He said thoughtfully, looking into the distance as if he were recalling a memory. “Yer mother was one o’ the nicest people I knew.” Hagrid sighed. “Loved her sista even though her ‘Tuney’ hated her guts. I s’ppose yeh’re the same.” “Well, it’s just,” Harry fiddled with his words for a bit, nervousness pumping through his veins. “I don’t like the thought of them being stranded out there.” “Alright, alright,” chuckled Hagrid, waving down a fisherman who was chilling by some shipments. The fisherman, previously occupied with lighting his cigarette, took a double take when he took in Hagrid’s size. “Hey, dyeh mind takin’ this boat back to the rock over there? There’s a fam’ly there, row them back to shore, won’t yeh?” The fisherman would’ve asked for payment if it were any other ordinary human being making the request, but Harry supposed that he was too intimidated by Hagrid’s towering size to say no. Keeping his head down, the fisherman got onto the rowboat that they got off, picking up the oars before hurrying back out to sea. Relieved at knowing the Dursleys would (probably) be okay, Harry picked up a small run to follow Hagrid up the stone steps into the street. Passers-by stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station, and honestly, Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as everyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary, mundane things like parking meters before saying loudly: “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” And when Harry said loud, he meant Hagrid was practically yelling through a megaphone. “Hagrid,” Harry said, panting a bit as he had to run to keep up—  gosh  , Hagrid’s legs were long— “Just now… Did you say there were  dragons at Gringotts?” “Well, so they say.” Said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.” “You’d  like  one?” Harry, for the life of him, could not imagine why anyone wanted a five-storey-tall reptile that could breathe fire and leave destruction in its wake. He could understand wanting a  snake  as a pet, as those were… At least somewhat manageable, if you bought a smaller species— but a  dragon ? “Wanted one ever since I was a kid— here we go.” They had reached the station. Comparatively a busier place than the town, which was quiet and tranquil. Everywhere Harry looked, there were people carrying briefcases and bags, hurrying off to work in leather shoes and formal high-heels. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time, and it seemed like most were waiting for that ride. Hagrid, who didn’t understand ‘Muggle money’, gave the notes to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train, as they didn’t have to hurry off to places and would be sitting with nothing much to do for the twenty minutes trip to London. Hagrid himself took up two seats, and sat knitting what looked like a tiny canary-yellow circus tent for a pomeranian-sized creature. “Still got yer letter, Harry?” He said as he counted stitches under his breath. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. The paper felt nice to touch, with a mildly rough texture that made a soft ‘shaa’ noise if you rubbed your skin over it. “Good,” said Hagrid, grumbling when he lost count and went back to start again from the front. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry carefully pried the letter open, not wanting to rip it. He was still worried that the whole wizarding thing would not last long, that Hagrid’s world would chuck him back to the Dursleys before he could say ‘Privet Drive’. He wanted to keep the letter as a memory, as something he could hide under his pillow and look at wistfully. There, hidden behind the letter he had read last night. The ‘someone out there’ had turned out to be the deputy headmistress,  Minerva McGonagall — He really liked the name, as he had gone through a Greek/Roman mythology phase where he binge-read every book his school library had on the topic. There was a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed before.━━━━━━━ HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY UNIFORMFirst-year students will require:

Notes:

Honestly I'm just so impatient... As of currently I'm at the Ollivanders part for Diagon Alley and I'm just so eager to get going to Hogwarts :| Any thoughts on Harry's and Hagrid's relationship throughout this chapter? I haven't started 'adding' that much conversation, but I'm pretty proud of the part where Harry inquires about how the Dursleys are going to get off the island.







Chapter 5: Diagon Alley

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Harry had never been to London before. The beige brick walls and dark green columns fascinated him as he followed Hagrid through busy crowds, thankful for a moment that the man was so big and practically made the crowd part like the Red Sea. He felt a little underdressed in his flannel and too-big jeans, as he was among waves and waves of those dressed in smart suits and creaseless dresses— but no matter, for he was in London, and he was way too busy looking around to care. 

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, it was pretty obvious he wasn't used to getting there the 

ordinary 

way. Harry paused in his train of thought for a moment to consider that the Muggle way was probably not Hagrid’s definition of 

ordinary

, for he lived in a different world than Harry did. 

“I don’t know how Muggles manage without magic,” Hagrid said after having gotten stuck in the ticket barrier in the Underground and complaining loudly to the crowd in the 

entire station 

that the seats were too small and the trains were too slow. By now, Harry was sure that half of London had heard of the giant who was twice the height of everyone else. The giant grumbled once more as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up into a bustling road lined with shops. 

The streets would’ve been hard to navigate for a small, scruffy eleven-year-old who looked no taller than an average seven-year-old, but since the crowd parted for Hagrid, all Harry had to do was stick closely behind him (easier said than done, for Harry had to take ten steps for every two of Hagrid’s). They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger bars and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary (to Harry) street full of ordinary people— could there really be piles of gold underneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks (other than those sold in the local supermarket)? 

Although Hagrid had done him no harm so far, Harry was feeling slightly skeptical— it 

was 

possible that Hagrid was just fooling him and wanted to keep him undamaged to sell him into slavery or cart him off to the human trafficking ring. Harry was pretty sure there would be plenty of people on the Black Market who’d be more than pleased to buy his kidneys. Then again, he was small and (in the friendly librarian’s words) malnourished— 

healthy 

would be the last word used to describe little Harry Potter.  Surely people on the Black Market wanted organs from healthy… er… donors? 

“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt and cutting off Harry’s thoughts of the human trafficking ring. “The Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.” 

It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub— if you left it up to Harry, he would say that it looked anything 

but 

famous. Before Hagrid pointed it out, Harry never noticed the shop, just like the people walking by, who didn’t spare a second glance at the front. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. Harry suddenly had a peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could bring this up, however, Hagrid had steered him inside. 

For a ‘famous’ place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe that was approximately the length of Harry’s arm. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old barman, who was quite bald and looked like a good candidate to play Humpty Dumpty. Harry winced at this thought as it felt rather rude. He instantly apologised in his head to the bartender. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in, however. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid— they waved and smiled at him, and the barman searched for a glass, saying: “The usual, Hagrid?” 

“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business.” said Hagrid, clamping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder with such force that the boy’s knees buckled. 

“Good lord.” said the barman. 


Tom

, Harry recalled. 

Sorry, Tom

, he murmured mentally. 

“Is this— could this be—?” 

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. Harry could’ve sworn he felt ants crawling up his legs and up his back under his shirt, the temperature of his fingers dropping a good twenty degrees. Every eye in the vicinity was on him, and it occurred to Harry how terrible life had been for the boa constrictor, if being in a glass display case felt anything like where he was at the moment. 

“Bless my soul,” whispered the old barman (

Tom

, Harry reminded himself). “Harry Potter… What an honour.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed towards Harry with tears in his eyes, and seized Harry’s hand. “Welcome back, Mr Potter,” said Tom. “

Welcome back

.” 

Harry was at a loss of words, for all the vocabulary he had learned through spending 

hours 

upon 

hours 

in the library had abandoned him, leaving him defenseless in a room of people who looked at him like he solved world poverty. There was a cacophony of chairs scraping against the floor, and the next thing he knew, Harry was shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. 

“Doris Crockford, Mr Potter. I can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” 

“So proud, Mr Potter. I’m just so proud.” 

“Always wanted to shake your hand— I’m all of a flutter.” 

“Delighted, Mr Potter, just can’t tell you. Diggle’s the name. Dedalus Diggle.” said a familiar-looking man with a top hat. Harry squinted at him for a moment, digging around in his memories for reference. 

“I remember you,” Harry said suddenly, thinking of the time Aunt Petunia was forced to take him on a grocery run because she didn’t trust him alone at home. A strange, tiny man with a violet top hat bowed to him, leaving Dudley upset and Aunt Petunia fuming— he had never known why, and at that time, never dared ask as Aunt Petunia was absolutely livid about the whole incident. “You bowed to me once in a shop.” 

“He remembers me!” cried Dedalus Diggle, as if Harry had just given him 10% of credit for solving world poverty. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” 

Harry shook hands again and again for what seemed like forever— Doris Crockford kept coming for more— Harry was sure he’d memorised the shape of Crockford’s hand— there was a numbness seeping into his arm now— 

A pale young man made his way to the front of the crowd, wearing a lovely lilac turban. Harry felt like Aunt Petunia would 

love 

that shade of purple for curtains in the kitchen. The man must’ve been very nervous, as one of his eyes was twitching uncontrollably. 

“Professor Quirrell!” greeted Hagrid, clapping his hand on Harry’s back once more . Harry almost choked out his heart from the force.

“Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” 

“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, his eyes shifting from corner to corner of the pub, as long as they were anywhere 

but 

Harry’s gaze. “C-Can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to m-meet you.” 

“It’s nice to meet you too, Professor,” responded Harry, resisting the urge to hide behind something- Like Hagrid. Everything was way too loud, and he was overwhelmed by the unending number of people who seemed to look up to him as if he were a hero and not just an ordinary, scruffy little eleven-year-old. He could sympathize with how nervous his professor felt— Anxiety got the worst of Harry sometimes, too. “If you don’t… If you don’t mind me asking, what do you teach, sir?” 

“D-Defence Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-Not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously, “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've got to p-pick up a new b-book on v-vampires, myself.” He looked terrified at the thought. 

The others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself, as the nervous man was pushed away by an onslaught of witches and wizards eager to shake hands with the Boy-Who-Lived. It took almost ten minutes for them to get away, and even then, Hagrid had to raise his voice. Apparently, it took about a room of about thirty people to create enough noise to overpower Hagrid. 

“Must get on— lots ter buy. Come on, Harry,” said Hagrid finally, much to the disappointment of the sulking crowd. Harry was relieved, at least— he had never talked to that many people, all at once, in his entire life, and was already feeling very, 

very 

drained. 

Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time before letting Hagrid lead him away through the bar and an old, wooden door with crossing metal plates into a walled courtyard, which contained a waste disposal bin and a few weeds. 

“Told yeh, didn’t I?” said Hagrid as he grinned at Harry. “Told yeh yer were famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh— mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.” 

“Is he usually this nervous?” Harry asked, hoping the question didn’t come off as impolite. For a moment, Harry wondered if people in the wizarding world used antidepressants. He had once read about them in a book and the librarian had been kind enough to let him use the spare laptop in the librarian’s office to read lightly about it on the internet. 

“Oh, yeah,” Hagrid answered. “Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine when he was studyin’ out of books but then he took a year off ter get some first-hand experience… They say he met vampires in the Black Forest and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag— never been the same since. Scared of his sudents— scared of his subject… Now, where’s me umbrella?” 

Harry blinked slowly, trying to steady his thoughts to prevent his mind from derailing off the track. Vampires… Hags… His mind was swimming with questions, and he was already thinking about libraries in the wizarding world, thinking about all the reading and research he wanted to do. Meanwhile, Hagrid was… Counting bricks. 

“Three up… Two across…” He muttered, until the moment of eureka came and he grinned a little ‘aha!’ under his breath. “Right… Stand back, Harry.” 

Harry’s curiosity only grew, sprouting like a plant that had been given a truckload of fertiliser. Hagrid tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella, a wide grin on his face when he noticed how intrigued the scruffy boy looked. 

Much to Harry’s awe and amazement, the brick that Hagrid touched started quivering, like an egg about to hatch. It wriggled, as if trying to squirm out of its place. A few moments later, it successfully did so, leaving a hole in the wall of the courtyard. Heavenly light shone through the hole, like the sun did through a gap in the clouds after a rainy morning. Gradually, more and more bricks, following the example of the first brick, started wriggling, folding themselves back onto one another until the wall had opened up into an archway leading into a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.

“Welcome,” Hagrid said proudly, gesturing to the street ahead of them, “to Diagon Alley.” 

The emerald-eyed boy was filled to the brim with excitement. Magic would never cease to amaze him, Harry thought, eagerly following Hagrid into the winding street. As he turned around to look back at the archway, he found that the bricks had already folded themselves back in place, and it was as if Harry and Hagrid had never passed through it in the first place. 

The sun pattered down onto the cauldrons in the display window of the nearest shop. They came in various, gleaming colours of tinted copper, glinting silver, and elegant gold. There was one made in a polished ebony that Harry particularly liked. ‘

Cauldrons— Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver— Self-stirring— Collapsible

,’ said the advertisement sign above them. 

“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, noticing where his gaze had wandered off to. “But we gotta get yer money first.” 

Harry wished he had eight more eyes. He turned his head rapidly as they carried down the street, looking left and right and behind, trying to take in everything: The shops, the things in the shops, the people doing their shopping— 

A plump woman outside the apothecary was shaking her head, looking quite like Aunt Petunia when she couldn’t bargain a cheaper price for the groceries. “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad…” 

A chorus of low hoots came from a dark shop with the sign ‘

Eeylops Owl Emporium— Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown & Snowy

’. Harry remembered that his letter said he could get 

an 

owl, and made a mental note to ask Hagrid if they could go take a look later. Several boys about Harry’s age, but were a good head taller than him, had their noses pressed up against the glass of a shop displaying brooms. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “The new Nimbus Two Thousand— fastest ever—”. There were also shops selling robes, telescopes and intricate silver instruments Harry had never seen before. There were windows with barrels of bat spleens and jars of eels eyes, tottering stacks of colourfully-binded books, quills and rolls of parchments, tubs of luminescent ink, potion bottles, globes of the moon… 

“Gringotts.” said Hagrid, stopping abruptly. 

A slender, marble building towered up above them. Pillars that reminded Harry of Greek temples framed the entrance, built at tilted angles that didn’t quite match up across the three floors. Faded gold embellishments told Harry that the bank was once the grandest structure on the street, but time had worn it down into a grey-ish building that was intimidating, in an older, wiser way. Standing by its burnished bronze doors, dressed in a uniform of scarlet and gold, was—

“Yep, that’s a goblin.” whispered Hagrid as they walked up the white stone steps. The goblin who bowed to them was about a head shorter than Harry, with a swarthy, clever-looking face, and abnormally long appendages. 

Don’t stare

, Harry reprimanded himself, 

It’s rude

. 

Now they were facing another set of doors, silver this time, with the following words engraved: 


ENTER, STRANGER, BUT TAKE HEED



OF WHAT AWAITS THE SIN OF GREED



FOR THOSE WHO TAKE, BUT DO NOT EARN



MUST PAY MOST DEARLY IN THEIR TURN



SO IF YOU SEEK BENEATH OUR FLOORS



A TREASURE THAT WAS NEVER YOURS 



THIEF, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, BEWARE 



OF FINDING MORE THAN TREASURE THERE


“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” said Hagrid. 

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they entered a wide, marble hall. The room was shaped like an octagon— an octagon, except with perhaps thirty sides, which was a polygon that Harry didn’t know the name of. Hundreds of goblins were working in the room, sitting on stools and scribbling on ledgers. Some of them were weighing coins on brass scales, and some of them were examining jewels through thick eye glasses. There were too many doors leading off from the hall for Harry to count, but the goblins seemed to know their way around as they led customers without faltering. 

“Mornin’,” Hagrid said after he and Harry made their way to a counter with a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Harry Potter’s safe.” 

Harry, who had seen another customer bow lightly to a goblin, thought he should do the same. Awkwardly, he dipped his head gently, not noticing the surprised expression that flitted through the goblin’s face. By the time he looked up, the goblin had schooled his face back to a business-like one and turned back to Hagrid, “You have his key, sir?” 

“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid as he started emptying his pockets on the counter, scattering a handful of mouldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose and Harry gave him an apologetic look. Since it looked like Hagrid was going to take a while, Harry preoccupied himself by taking an interest in the goblin beside them, who was weighing rubies the size of glowing coals.

Just as Harry was sure the goblin was about to kick them out, Hagrid made a triumphant grunt and pulled out a tiny golden key that shimmered under the light. 

“Got it.” Hagrid said at last. 

The goblin eyed it, making a displeased huff when he finally deemed it satisfactory. “That seems to be in order.”

“An’ I’ve got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, puffing his chest up a little. Something in his coat jingled. “It’s about You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” 

The goblin read the letter carefully before heaving a sigh. “Very well,” He said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!” 

Griphook was yet another goblin. Harry dipped his head to bow, like he had done earlier, and winced when his hair flopped limply with his movements. This time, as he looked up, he caught the pleasant surprise on the goblin’s face, as well as the tint of amusement in his eyes. Flushing in embarrassment, Harry mumbled incoherently and ruffled his hair back into place, hoping he looked decent. 

Once Hagrid finished recollecting all his dog biscuits, he and Harry followed Griphook to one of the doors leading away from the hall. Expecting to see more marble, Harry was slightly shocked when they entered a narrow stone tunnel instead. Wooden beams held up the ceiling, lit by torches that blazed with an amber fire. Rails led down the tunnel, going further than Harry’s eyesight. 

Griphook whistled, and a small cart came speeding up the sloped tunnel. The goblin got in, and Harry followed. Lastly, Hagrid clambered in, with difficulty, and they were off. Awe coloured Harry’s eyes as they went speeding down the rails. He couldn’t help but imagine that this must be what a roller coaster ride felt like. Dudley had bragged all about the rides at Disneyland, and Harry hadn’t been able to help feeling glum at that time. 

They hurtled down the passage, coming to crossroads a few times, going left, right, right, middle fork, left, right, left, left— the rattling cart seemed to have been charmed to know its way, because Griphook sure as hell wasn’t steering. On the contrary, the goblin looked like he was really enjoying himself, watching Hagrid turn greener by the second. 

Harry had to grab a hold onto his glasses to make sure they didn’t fly off. Cold air surged towards them like a stampede of terrified horses, and still Harry forced his eyes open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of the passage and turned around to see if there was a dragon, but too late— they were already plunging even deeper, now miles and miles under London. 

At last the cart swivelled into a small passage, and ahead of them was a great gold door with complex contraptions surrounding it. There were wheels interlocked among each other across the entrance to the vault, which had its plate number above the frame. They all got out, and Harry swore that Griphook stifled a snort under his breath when Hagrid had to lean against the wall for a few moments to let his stomach settle. 

Anticipation tingled at Harry’s fingertips as Griphook inserted his key into the lock, which was tucked in the very corner, with only a small space between all the wheels and knobs for one to reach through. With a dramatic ‘whoosh’, the door swung open, releasing puffs of green gas. Harry gasped as it cleared: Inside the vault were mounds of gold coins, columns of silver coins, and heaps of the little bronze Knuts. 

“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. Harry couldn’t believe his eyes— all this time, when the Dursleys had been yelling at him for being a burden and a sinkhole of money, there was a small fortune in 

his 

name, miles under London. There was no way Harry could ever let Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia find out about all that money, for they would take it from him before he could blink.

Harry was smiling so wide he was surprised his cheeks hadn’t started hurting. He had been worried that the Dursleys would chuck him out once he was of age, that he would become a penniless, homeless wanderer in the streets of London— but now that he knew he had the funding, Harry was eager to look into ways to invest his money so that he would be well-off once he was kicked out. 

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of the money into a bag and let the boy hold onto it. There was no wiping the smile off Harry’s face as they walked back to the cart, the jingle of coins echoing about. 

“The gold ones are Galleons,” Hagrid grunted, climbing back into the cart. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?” 

Griphook grinned widely. “One speed only.” 

The hurtled back into the depths of London, going faster now that the rails were steeper. The air around got colder and colder, although neither Hagrid nor Griphook seemed to mind. Hagrid, Harry supposed, didn’t mind as he was big and had a huge coat on. Griphook, on the other hand, didn’t seem like he would generate a lot of body heat— were goblins cold-blooded, then? Harry wanted to ask, but felt like it sounded rude. Hopefully Hogwarts would have a library with books about goblins— Harry could get his answers there. 

Curious, Harry peered over the cart when they rattled over an underground ravine, disappointed when he couldn't see the bottom. Griphook seemed amused by his interest while Hagrid only groaned and pulled him back from the edge. At last, they slowed once more, and got off in front of the door of vault seven hundred and thirteen. 

Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 

“Stand back,” Griphook said importantly, smile widening when he noticed the attentive way Harry was staring at him. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers, and to Harry’s growing wonder— the door simply 

melted 

away. The molten gold of the door sunk into the ground, disappearing even though there was no place for the liquid to leak into. “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped there.” 

“How often do you check to see if someone’s inside?” asked Harry, unable to hold back his curiosity. 

Griphook’s eyes twinkled as he smiled rather nastily. “Once every ten years.” For some reason, Harry had a feeling that the goblin particularly enjoyed checking. 

Eager to see what treasure the top-security vault held, Harry peered as Hagrid shuffled inside. He had expected to see mounds of money, jewels, artifacts— but his eyes saw none of that. At first, he thought the vault was empty— that was until Hagrid bent over and picked up a small, grubby package the size of Harry’s hands clenched together, wrapped tightly in brown paper and tied with twine. The package went into the depths of Hagrid’s coat, and they were off again, 

One wild cart ride later, they were back on the surface. Hagrid looked ready to kiss the floor when they finally stopped. Harry uttered his thanks to Griphook, offering the goblin a polite smile for his help. When Harry was younger, when Aunt Petunia still took him out for grocery trips, he had learnt that the workers behind the counters would be easily pleased if they were just offered a sweet ‘thank you!’ and a smile. Some even told him that he had just made their day. Harry loved making other people smile like that, as he rarely pleased the Dursleys, so he swore to do it as often as possible. The desired effect didn’t exactly happen, however. Griphook simply looked like he wanted to say something after the gesture, but elected against it as he just nodded and walked away. 

Hagrid sighed happily as they stepped out from the Gringotts' doors, bathed under the light of mid-morning London. Harry didn’t know where to go first now that he had money— he didn’t need to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he had more money than the Dursleys could ever dream off. Besides, if the exchange rate ruled in the pounds’ favour, Harry could always just melt all the gold coins he had, sell the molten gold off, and use the money to buy a ton of silver. Harry was sure that the price of silver, as compared to gold, was very low. Then, with the large amount of silver he had, he could have someone mold that into Sickles. Seventeen Sickles were a Galleon, and going by the current gold-to-silver ratio, he’d probably end up with approximately twice the amount of Galleons he had in the first place. 

“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding towards ‘Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions’. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” The giant looked rather sick, so Harry nodded and reassured him that he would be fine. Hagrid stumbled off towards the pub, and Harry entered the shop alone, feeling very nervous now that he was all by himself. 

The inside of the shop was painted in a lovely, dark purple. Unending oak racks lined the walls, filled to the brim with garments in every colour Harry could imagine. A few mannequins stood, headless, in the display window of the shop, dressed in flowy silk dresses fit for a royal tea party. Rolls of fabrics with 

moving 

silver embroidery were stacked upon each other for customers to choose from should they want a customised garment. There were classy dark blues and mossy greens among vibrant magentas and eye-catching scarlets. The whole shop was a palette of the world’s most exquisite colours squished into one, small lot, and Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away. 

 Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. Her smile reminded Harry of the librarian in his old school, and she felt just like the kind of neighbour everyone wanted to have— the neighbour who would bake extra cookies and bring them over every weekend. 

“Hogwarts, dear?” She said, amused when Harry opened and closed his mouth as he fumbled with what to say. He nodded shyly, flushing when she gave him a knowing smile and a reassuring pat on the head. “Got the lot here— another young man being fitted up right now, in fact.”

She led him to the back of the shop, her warm hand pressed up against his back as she ushered him next to a pale, sharp-faced boy standing on a footstool. A second witch was pinning down the flappy black robe that was draped over the boy, shaping it to the blonde boy’s size. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool just like the one the other boy was on, draping a ready-made robe over him and using what seemed to be magical white chalk to draw a thin line so Harry wouldn’t go about dragging an oversized robe that he would most likely end up tripping on. 

“Hello,” said the boy, raising an eyebrow importantly. “Hogwarts, too?”

“Yes.” mumbled Harry in reply. He wasn’t very keen to have a conversation with a wizard just yet. His lack of knowledge about the magical world could very well cause him to unknowingly insult someone. 

“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” The boy drawled, sounding bored, as if getting custom-fitted robes was a luxury that he got to have every day. Harry couldn’t even remember the last time he had clothes that 

fit

. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 

No

, Harry chided himself as Madam Malkin pinched the fabric around his arm.

 I shouldn’t pre-judge him and make assumptions. 


“Have 

you

 got your own broom?” The whole time, the boy had just kept going on with his mostly one-sided conversation, and Harry was more than happy to keep his mouth shut and listen. However, now that the blonde boy was staring at him expectantly, Harry was pressured to come up with a reply. 

“Um… No,” replied Harry, choosing to fascinate himself with what Madam Malkin was doing instead of looking at the boy. He could already imagine getting ridiculed for not having a broom, just like how he was ridiculed for having glasses and a scar. 

“Play Quidditch at all?” 

“No,” mumbled Harry.

The blonde boy gave him a weird look before shrugging and going on. “Well, 

I

 do— Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?” 

Feeling more and more stupid by the minute, Harry mentally prayed for Madam Malkin to finish up on his robes as soon as possible so he could escape the situation. “No.” he said, hoping that he didn’t sound like a complete idiot, in case houses were a very common knowledge in the magical world. 

 “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been. Imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” The boy didn’t really seem to mind that Harry didn’t have much to say. In fact, Harry was sure the boy enjoyed dominating the conversation. 

“Mmm,” mumbled Harry, wondering what in the world a Hufflepuff was and why it was so bad that the boy would leave. 

“I say, look at that man!” The boy said suddenly, causing the witch working on his robe to sigh disgruntledly. Harry turned to see Hagrid in the shop window, grinning and waving while pointing at the two ice cream cones he was holding in one hand to explain why he couldn’t come in. A small, relieved smile twitched onto the dark-haired boy’s lips at the sight of a familiar face. It wasn’t that he had expected Hagrid to abandon him in Diagon Alley, like Aunt Petunia had once done in a grocery store— but it was comforting to know that the giant had come back for him. 

“That’s Hagrid,” Harry said softly, feeling shy. The boy didn’t seem to know who the giant man was, and it felt nice to share something into the conversation. “He works at Hogwarts.” 

“Oh,” said the boy, scrunching up his nose, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” 

This made Harry twitch uncomfortably, prompting Madam Malkin to hush and swat him lightly. “He’s the gamekeeper,” he tried to explain, a dreadful feeling pouring into his stomach like a gushing pipe. 

“Yes, exactly.” said the blonde dismissively, “I heard he’s a sort of savage— lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.” The boy laughed, as if he had just told a funny joke. 

“Well, I— I—” Harry fumbled with his words. Normally, he’d just be smart and keep his mouth shut. Disagreeing with people never got him anywhere good, but at that moment, Harry felt 

awful

, and he had a feeling he’d feel 

worse 

if he didn’t say anything. “I… I think he’s brilliant,” Harry mumbled the last part. 

“

Do 

you?” The boy said with a slight sneer, “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?” 

Harry felt his heart drop onto the floor— it landed on the footstool with a solid 

thump 

before rolling onto the cold stone. Sneers and jeers already filled his brain. Soon enough, everyone at Hogwarts would know that his parents were gone, and everywhere he went, people would point their noses away from him, looking down on him as he was buried alive under their whispers. 

Orphan

, they would say, 

It’s him, the one whose parents died

. 

“They… They’re dead.” Harry said, so softly that he was sure no one heard. 

“Oh,” said the boy stiffly, “But they were 

our 

kind, weren’t they?” 

“They were witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean,” Harry said after a moment. “Does it matter?” 
A sharp laugh came from the other, as if Harry had just asked a ridiculous question. “Of course it matters! The other sort…” He scrunched up his nose in disgust, as if uttering the words put a foul taste in his mouth. “They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”
Thankfully, before Harry could execute ‘panic mode’, Madam Malkin spoke up, giving him a kind smile. “That’s you done, dear.” The conversation was starting to get on his nerves, and Harry was more than happy for a reason to get away. 

“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose.” drawled the boy. “Name’s Draco Malfoy, by the way. From the House of 

Malfoy

.” 

Harry had no idea what the House of Malfoy was, but it seemed pretty important. For all he knew, the blonde boy might be some sort of royalty in the magical world, and Harry wasn’t exceptionally keen to get listed into an important family’s bad books. 

“See you,” Harry gave Draco a polite bow, and for good measure, a small smile as he tried not to stammer. “H-Have a nice day.” 

“What’s up?” Apparently, Hagrid was much more perceptive than Harry thought. He had been rather quiet while he enjoyed his ice cream, chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts, it was the best thing Harry had had in 

weeks

, and the big man had picked up on it. 

“Nothing,” Harry lied. 

They dipped into a shop for parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit as he picked up a batch of regular-looking quills, wanting to start practicing writing with them as soon as possible. His smile brightened even more when Hagrid let him buy an ink that would change colour as you wrote, giving you a page of writing that went from red to pink and yellow and orange. 

When they left the shop, Harry remembered something he wanted to ask. “Hagrid,” he started politely, hoping that he wouldn’t sound too dumb. “What’s quidditch?” 

“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know— not knowin’ about Quidditch!” Hagrid smacked his face with his hand, as if berating himself for not mentioning it earlier. 

Reluctantly, Harry confessed his conversation with the blonde boy at Madam Malkin’s. “And… And he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t be allowed in…” 

Before Harry could finish his sentence, Hagrid cut him off.  “Yer not 

from

 a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh 

were

— he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles— look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”

The direction of the conversation was starting to irk Harry. He could have half a brain and would still be able to realise that Hagrid wasn’t exactly signing praises about the Dursleys. Sure, he wasn’t particularly fond of Aunt Petunia, but he didn’t like people talking about the only family he’d ever known in that tone and manner, either. 

“So,” hoping to realign the conversation in a better direction, Harry piped up. “What 

is 

quidditch?” 

 “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like— Like football in the Muggle world— Everyone follows Quidditch— Played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls— Sorta hard ter explain the rules.m Hagrid waved his hand around aimlessly as he spoke. 

Harry felt a bit bewildered. He had played football in school (and was always picked last), and he found it dangerous enough with his feet planted on the ground. Quidditch sounded pretty dangerous to Harry, but he supposed, in some aspect, it sounded a tad bit fun, too. 

“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” he asked, remembering the weird terms Draco Malfoy had brought up. Curiosity was brimming in his eyes as he recalled how the blonde had been repulsed at the idea of 

Hufflepuff

. 

 “School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but—” Hagrid winced a bit as he said the last bit, like it was a thing everyone said but knew was mean. 

Harry drooped immediately. “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” he mumbled gloomily. 

“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” 

Harry blinked. “Vol-, sorry— You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” He found it rather difficult to imagine an evil wizard once attending boarding school, just like everyone else. If it were left up to him, he’d imagine that Voldermort spent his earlier years in terrible, dreary places instead of behind a desk, quill with hand. 

“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. 

Harry pondered about this for a moment. “So if you’re sorted into Slytherin,” he said slowly, “You’re destined to be evil?” 

Words seemed to fail Hagrid for a moment. 

“Sorry if this is rude, but,” Harry hesitated. “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone like me, who knows nothing about houses, went to Hogwarts and was placed into Slytherin, and then— then they learn that everyone in their house goes bad?” 

“Well,” Hagrid seemed to find his voice at last, “I supp’se it’sa bit of a bias, really. There are a handful of good Slytherins— take Severus Snape for example. He’s yer potions professor.” 

Harry nodded. 

“But ya can’t deny,” The man continued as they stopped in front of a shop called Flourish and Blotts, “That a good number of them turn out bad.” 

Flourish and Blotts was the dream bookstore of Harry’s primary school librarian. The shelves stretched up onto the ceiling, curving inwards as they reached the tip. Books as large as paving stones sat on the lower shelves, bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps done in silk colours were placed in little baskets that could be pulled from the shelves. There were books with peculiar glowing symbols on the spine, calling out to Harry from their place in the shop. 

If Harry had to describe the bookshop in one word, it would be 

magical

. 

His eyes were captivated by the rows and rows of titles. Eagerness bubbled up within him as he forgot about his worries for a moment. Knowledge was gathered in the store like gold in a dragon’s hoard— it was absolutely endless and Harry couldn’t wait to get started. 

A kind lady in the shop noticed them, or rather, she noticed Hagrid— It was rather difficult not to, and offered her help. Harry shyly gave her the letter containing the books he needed. She gave an understanding ‘

ah

’, and withdrew a slim, mahogany wand from her robes. The wood was carved so that it swirled around the core and shallowed out towards the tip. With a simple 

flick

, 

flick

, and 

swish

 of her wand, books came flying from all corners of the shop, swooping around the other customers until they all settled, stacked upon each other, on her hand. 

“Wow,” Harry couldn’t help himself. He was shocked breathless at the display of magic, and the awe in his eyes conveyed it. The lady gave a light giggle. “Thank you.” 

“No problem, dear,” she smiled, “It’s always such fun to show off a little magic in front of those that are easily amazed.” 

They spent a little longer in the bookshop, leaving only when Hagrid pried Harry away. The boy felt a little saddened when they exited the store— there had been so many interesting titles among the shelves, and the green-eyed boy knew he could be entertained for 

weeks

, if not 

months 

if he was left to read the contents of the entire shop. 

They went to buy him a cauldron next. Harry was more than happy with his pewter one, as he thought it was just the right colour— a sharp sort of black that felt muffled at the same time. It wasn’t too bright, and it wasn’t too heavy, either: Just the right weight for a small eleven-year-old boy to carry. At the same shop, which seemed to specialise in metal equipment, they got some copper scales for measuring potion ingredients as well as a collapsible telescope. 

The apothecary was next on their trip, and it was interesting enough to make up for the smell. The place smelt like someone had blended bad eggs and rotten cabbages together before spraying it everywhere like Febreze. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. There was something to look at in every inch of the place, so Harry fascinated himself with that while Hagrid asked the man over the counter for basic potion supplies. 

Outside the apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again. “Just yer wand left—” Hagrid hummed thoughtfully, “A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” 

Harry didn’t need a mirror to know he had gone red. “You don’t have to—” he began. Getting to go to Diagon Alley— to have lived a (probably brief) dream outside of Privet Drive— was already the best present he could ask for. He knew that the trip would be ingrained in his memory for the many, many years to come, and whenever he felt particularly upset, or whenever Uncle Vernon locked him up in his cupboard— or room— he would think about Diagon Alley, and the kind, great man known as Hagrid. 

 “I know I don’t have to,” said Hagrid gruffly, ruffling Harry’s hair. There was a twitch of a smile under his beard. “Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at— an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.” 

Twenty minutes later, Harry’s eyes were ablaze with more joy than he had ever experienced in his whole life. They were just walking out of Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dim and full of rustling and jewel-bright eyes. Harry carried a large cage in his hands, cradling it like his most prized possession. Sitting inside the cage, calmly looking around at the commotion going on around the alley, was a beautiful snowy owl. 

She had stared at him from the moment he stepped into the shop, and unlike the other owls, who hooted for his attention, the snowy simply watched him quietly, beckoning to him with a silent voice. Eventually, he was drawn in by her calm demeanor, and approached her cage with a soft tone. To show her approval, the snowy shifted along her perch, moving closer to the edge of the cage to preen and coo softly. It was at the moment that the bird snagged Harry's heart, and he didn’t reckon he’d be getting it back anytime soon (he didn’t mind, though!). 

It had been a couple minutes and Harry was still stammering his thanks (doing his best impression of Professor Quirrel). 

 “Don’ mention it,” Chuckled Hagrid, ruffling Harry’s hair again. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now— only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” 

Harry’s jaw dropped onto the cobblestone pavement. He read his list— he knew that he was going to need a wand— but it still felt so unreal that he had to do a double-take to register what Hagrid had said. He was getting a wand! The sentence felt so infused with joy that Harry let it roll around in his mind for a little longer, crushing out any lingering sadness still left in his consciousness. 

Ollivanders was a narrow shop, tucked cosily away in Diagon Alley. The letters on the sign, once a vibrant gold, were now peeling off, but Harry could still make out what they said— ‘Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C’. A single wand laid on a faded purple cushion in the one tiny display window the shop could afford to have. Fascination burst at the seams of Harry’s blood vessels as he stepped into the shop, feeling as though he’d stepped into the setting of a fairytale story instead. 

A single bell rang somewhere deep in the shop when the door closed behind them. The walls stretched with shelves that tilted and slanted at angles, and atop those shelves were boxes stacked among boxes stacked among more boxes. Harry thought it rather looked like a messy shoe warehouse. 

There was no other furniture in the shop other than a thin spindly chair that Hagrid sat on. The chair squeaked in pain as it lowered a couple inches under the giant’s weight, but the man didn’t seem to notice. Harry continued to look around, feeling invisible gazes prickling at the back of his neck. Magic was present in the silence of the shop, exerting its presence in the silvery dust particles that danced whenever Harry took a small step. 

“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. 

Harry jumped, and Hagrid must’ve, too, for the boy heard the tell-tale pained squeak of the chair. The dark-haired boy had been at full alert, as something inside his soul told him that Ollivanders was a shop that held years and years of accumulated magic, similar to how old libraries had built-up collections of ancient texts from ages ago. Yet, even with all his senses at their finest, Harry had not detected the old man’s presence. 

“Hello,” Harry said, as that was the polite thing to do. “Good afternoon,” he added shyly. “May I buy a wand?” 

The old man had shiny bright eyes that looked like two moons, side by side, framed by a pair of wizened glasses. “Of course you can,” The man said with a soft, grandfatherly chuckle “I thought I’d be seeing you soon, Harry Potter.”

Harry felt his heart skip a beat when his name was whispered, like the sound of the wind brushing crisp tree leaves against each other. 

The old man peered at him, squinting through those narrow glasses of his before he spoke once more. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”

Words drowned in Harry’s throat as he stared at the man, speechless. 

“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it— it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander waved his hand around aimlessly. 

The wandmaker stepped even closer to Harry, close enough that Harry could see his slightly frightened face reflected in the silvery orbs. A light finger came up to his forehead, and before Mr. Ollivander could trace the lightning-shaped scar hidden by Harry’s dark, messy bangs, the boy had slipped beyond reach, looking wary. 

A quizzical look passed over the old man’s face, but if he found Harry’s behaviour peculiar, he didn’t voice it. “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly, continuing as if nothing had happened. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands… Well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do…” 

The man shook his head, as if he was seeing through his memories the very day the purchase had happened. Then, to Harry’s relief, Mr. Ollivander spotted Hagrid. Though, honestly, how could anyone 

not 

spot him? 

 “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again… Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” The mysterious, foreboding Mr. Ollivander was gone, now replaced by a white-haired man waddling over to the giant with a greeting smile. 

 “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid with a jovial smile. 

 “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. 

“Er— Yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet, looking like a child who had been caught stealing candy from the pantry. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly. 

“But you don’t 

use

 them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply. 

“Oh no, sir,” Hagrid reassured the man hastily. Interestingly enough, Harry noted, the giant gripped his pink umbrella tighter and held it behind his back, as if he were trying to hide it from Ollivander. Were the pieces of Hagrid’s wand inside the umbrella? He had, after all, used it to give Dudley a pig tail, and later on, he had used it to speed up their boat ride. 

“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, a hint of disbelief in his tone. The giant was subjected to a piercing, scrutinizing look, but he was let off the hook as the old man didn’t pursue the matter any further. “Well, now— Mr. Potter. Let me see…” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” 

“Er— Well, I’m right-handed.” said Harry. 

“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” 

Harry realised with a start, as the measuring tape took the width of his nose, that it was doing the measuring all on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting from shelf to shelf, selecting boxes with a discerning eye, looking busier than a Walmart shopkeeper on Christmas eve. 

“That will do,” said Mr. Ollivander. The measuring tape jolted to a stop and dropped into a heap on the floor, as if the gravity button on it had finally been switched on. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.” 

Feeling foolish, Harry waved the wand awkwardly, trying to recall what the magician, who his primary school hired for children’s day, had done. Mr. Ollivander snatched it away before he could do more, and for a moment Harry felt his heart drop. He was half-expecting the man to give him a disappointed look, saying something along the lines of ‘You’re awful. Go back to where you came from, you’re not suited to be a wizard’ before sending him home with Hagrid and instilling a ban preventing Harry Potter from ever interacting with the magical world ever again. 

“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try—” Mr. Ollivander interrupted Harry’s thoughts, handing him another wand. Feeling rather dizzy, Harry took it, but he had hardly gripped the wood when the man snatched it away once more. “No, no— here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”

Harry tried on wand after wand, feeling increasingly embarrassed as the number of stacked boxes grew. He was becoming surrounded by the identical, shoebox-sized cuboids, but Mr. Ollivander wasn’t slowing down at all— in fact, he looked happier and happier as he pulled more boxes from the shelves. 

“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere—” chirped Mr. Ollivander. It didn’t help Harry’s nerves, but he was relieved to know the man wasn’t annoyed at him for taking up so much time. “I wonder, now— yes, why not— unusual combination— holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” 

Harry reached for the wand, feeling the warmth at his fingertips even before he laid his hands on the polished wood. The warmth sprouted from his hands and coursed through the rest of the body, flowing in his blood and passing from cell to cell through osmosis. It was as if the wand had developed invisible roots the moment it touched Harry’s palm, anchoring itself to the very depths of Harry’s soul, clinging on, as if to tell him that his magic would never leave. 

Filled with a sudden bout of excitement, Harry raised his wand, flicking it sharply as the shape of the handle engraved itself into his right hand. A burst of silver and green sparks exploded from the tip of the wand just as a burst of awe and amazement exploded in Harry’s eyes. The sparks soared up above Harry, taking the form of fireworks and they spread out from the centre in a flower-like pattern. 

“Oh, bravo!” cried Mr. Ollivander as Hagrid whooped and cheered. “Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well… How curious… How very curious…” 

Harry’s heart clenched a little as Mr. Ollivander took the wand back, wrapping it in brown paper. 

“Curious… Curious…” muttered the man thoughtfully. 

Feeling a little more confident after his success, Harry voiced his question. “Sorry, but… Um… 

What’s

 curious?” 

Mr. Ollivander seemed to hesitate before he turned and met Harry’s eyes with a pale, fixed stare. “I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather— just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother— why, its brother gave you that scar.” 

Harry swallowed, feeling his flight or fight instinct rouse from the depths. It stirred, like a sea monster that had been asleep, flicking its great tail so that it barely missed the line of the surface, lingering just beneath. 

“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember… I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter… After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.” Mr. Ollivander said ominously. 

Harry tried to keep his body still, locking his joints and keeping his muscles rigid, but he still shivered slightly. The wandmaker didn’t seem to have any bad intentions at heart, and Harry wouldn’t say that he 

hated 

Mr. Ollivander, but… But he would say that the man made him feel uneasy, and the dark-haired boy couldn’t wait to get away. They paid seven galleons for his holly and phoenix feather wand, and Harry bowed back when Mr. Ollivander did so to bid them farewell. 

The late afternoon sun hung low as Harry and Hagrid made their way back, retracing their steps through Diagon Alley and back into the Leaky Cauldron. The morning crowd was gone, and Tom was behind the counter, wiping the glasses with an old rag. The bartender waved at them as they passed, leaving the magical world behind and trekking through a judgemental London, although Harry was too distracted to notice the stares. Every pair of eyes in the vicinity was trailing after Hagrid’s large form, Harry’s skinny one, and the odd collection of weirdly-shaped packages they had with them. 

On the train, Harry cooed softly in reassurance as Hedwig glared and screeched at their fellow passengers, aware of the scrutinizing gazes that were being pointed at her boy. They got off at their stop, going up what seemed to be the longest escalator for Harry’s tired legs. Paddington Station took Harry by surprise, as he had been a bit out of it. The whole time, he had just been trailing after Hagrid, letting his mind run auto-pilot. 

“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” Hagrid said. 

He bought Harry a hamburger. Well technically, 

Harry 

was the one who made the purchase as the giant grumbled about Muggle currency, but the money was Hagrid’s. They sat down on bright highlighter yellow and green seats. Harry kept looking around, finding the Muggle world odd after dipping his foot in the magical world beyond the Leaky Cauldron. Hedwig sat on the plastic seat next to Harry, head tucked into her wing as she dozed off. 

 “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. 

Harry paused, trying to find the right words as he neatly folded back his hamburger wrapper. He’d just had the best birthday of his life— and yet something inside him felt uneasy and on edge. His flight or fight instinct never returned to deep slumber— It was just beneath the waves, and the passing of a small ship would be all it took to rouse the creature. 

“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last, feeling exceptionally self-conscious. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander… But I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry— I mean, the night my parents died.” 

Hagrid leaned across the table, wearing a kind smile that sparkled through his dark eyes. 

“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts— I did— still do, ’smatter of fact.” 

Harry took in the words, going over them in his head over and over again. The monster was still in light sleep, but it had retreated a little more, putting more distance between itself and the surface. There was still a lingering weight on Harry’s chest, but the burden had lightened a little, with the help of the kind man sitting across Harry in a cheap fast food store. 

Hagrid helped Harry onto his train, the one that would take him back to the Dursleys. When Harry was all settled down, the giant handed him an envelope with a grin. 

“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September— King’s Cross— it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me… See yeh soon, Harry.” 

The rumble of the engine began as the train stirred and stretched its muscles like a majestic predator, flexing its claws for a bountiful day of hunting. Harry turned to the window— he wanted to watch Hagrid until he was too far to see. The boy pressed his nose against the glass, a slight smile on his lips— but then he blinked, and Hagrid was gone.

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Harry’s last month at the Dursleys  wasn’t  fun. Dudley had become so scared of Harry that he wouldn’t stay in the same room. Whenever the smaller boy stepped into a room, his cousin would turn pale, as if he had just seen a ghost, before turning tail (quite literally, as the springy, pink pig’s tail was still sticking out of Dudley’s bottoms) and fleeing from the room. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon ignored Harry, pretending as if he wasn’t there— which was pretty normal. What  wasn’t  normal was Aunt Petunia  not  demanding for Harry to do his chores, and Uncle Vernon  not yelling ‘boy!’ everytime he caught sight of the scrawny brat. It was absolutely awful. Of course, Harry wasn’t fond of how he was treated by his relatives, but he’d rather go back to what they had before than the silent treatment they were making him sit through. Harry would come down every morning, preparing to start breakfast, but his Aunt would freeze and push him away, all without making eye contact. The same happened at lunch and dinner. With no chores to do, Harry found himself quite bored. He was left to his own devices, and with plenty of time in his hands, he began to page through his textbooks, absorbing the knowledge like a sponge in a bowl of water. He would jump from Charms to Defense to Potions, then perhaps a dabble in a bit of Herbology and Transfiguration. He named his snowy Hedwig, after a German witch he found in his History of Magic textbook. Hedwig was asleep for most of the day, and Harry would use a clean flannel shirt to cover her cage in the morning so that she would not be disturbed by the sunlight. In the evening, right after dinner, Hedwig would begin to coo softly, and Harry would respond by telling her all the interesting things he’d read that day. At night, Harry would open his windows to allow Hedwig free reign of the skies, and she would return from her adventures with a present (typically a rat). Thankfully, Aunt Petunia never came to check on him, for she would have a meltdown at the sight of a dismembered rat in his room. Every night, before going to bed, Harry would count down the days until the first of September, with Hedwig perched on the windowsill to keep him company. He would pet her gently before tucking himself in, falling asleep to the reassuring coos of his companion, drifting into slumber at the sounds of her pattering wings. On the last day of August, Harry rationalised that he could no longer delay the question any longer. He would have to ask for Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon to send him to Kings’ Cross Station the next day, so he reluctantly put down his Potions textbook (he was already halfway through it) and ventured into the living room, where they were watching a quiz show. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were seated on the lovers’ seat while Dudley took the single couch for himself, snacking on popcorn that was bought from a convenience store. Harry cleared his throat to announce his presence. Dudley jumped, and in the span of two seconds, let out a terrified screech, dropping the popcorn onto the floor and raced out of the living into the kitchen. “Um… Uncle Vernon?” Harry started nervously. Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. “Um, I… I need to be at Kings’ Cross Station tomorrow… To… To go to school.” Harry continued, omitting ‘Hogwarts’ as he had a feeling it wasn’t a favourite word of his relatives. Uncle Vernon grunted again. “Would… Would it be alright if you gave me a lift?” Harry finished hopefully. Grunt. Harry crossed his fingers and prayed that it meant a yes. “Thank you.” He was about to go upstairs when Uncle Vernon opened his mouth and spoke.  “Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Uncle Vernon half-sneered, eyes still glued to the television. Harry didn’t say anything. “Where is this school, anyway?” “Scotland,” Harry answered, thankful that he had started reading  History of Magic  , which had a section on Hogwarts, including information on  where  it was,  when  it was built, and by  whom . “The Highlands of Scotland.” “Hmph.” scoffed Uncle Vernon. “What train are you taking anyway?” “Um… The Hogwarts Express,” Harry fumbled awkwardly, starting to fidget with his fingers, “My… My ticket says to be at platform nine and three-quarters at eleven.” His Aunt and Uncle stared. “Platform what?” “N-N-Nine and three-quarters.” mumbled Harry, feeling more uncomfortable by the second. He didn’t like the interrogating tone that his Uncle was using on him— It made him feel like he had a plethora of slugs, ants and spiders crawling up his back under his shirt, and he wanted nothing more than the run and hide in his bedroom until he could feel the sensations fade away. “Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, with a face of disbelief. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”Harry mumbled inaudibly. “Speak up,  boy .” There it was, Harry thought. The term ‘ boy ’ felt a little unnatural, as Uncle Vernon hadn’t used it on him for a while. “It’s… It’s on my ticket.” He repeated, only loud enough to be heard. “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, turning back to face the telly. “Howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” Harry was curious about why his Aunt and Uncle were going to London, but thought it would be wise to keep his mouth shut. As it turned out, however, he didn’t have to ask. “Got to get that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.” grumbled Uncle Vernon, somewhat to himself and somewhat to Aunt Petunia, who nodded vigorously in agreement. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Harry woke up at five o’clock the next morning, shaking with so much excitement that he couldn’t go back to sleep. Hedwig had returned sometime during the night, and was currently perched on the end of Harry’s bed frame, guarding the dark-haired boy watchfully. She hooted in greeting when he woke, hopping into his reach happily when he made a motion of petting her. “Today’s the day, Hedwig.” Harry whispered to her, eyes bright with anticipation. The snowy cooed, pressing her head into the palm of his hand, providing encouragement even though she wasn’t capable of speech. A warm feeling swelled inside the boy’s chest, and he set himself to smoothing out Hedwig’s feathers while he continued to talk. “I’m feeling kind of nervous,” confessed Harry as he was working through Hedwig’s left wing. The owl had let him raise her wing gently without complaint. Typically, owls were rather bristly creatures, but one just couldn’t help it under the boy’s soft, kind touch. “What if I mess up? What if people hate me?” Hedwig snapped at him playfully, as if saying  don’t be idiotic, Harry, get rid of that thought right this instance . “Even if everyone hates me, you won’t, right?” Harry asked softly, brushing past Hedwig’s snowy white feathers, admiring the black specks scattered randomly between them. The owl nipped his fingers gently, careful as to not leave a wound with her sharp beak. Harry spent the next hour petting Hedwig while reading his Potions textbook, animatedly telling the snowy about the procedures needed to make forgetfulness potion. At half past six, he got up and changed into jeans and a t-shirt, knowing that his relatives would throw a fit if he wore his robes on the way to Kings’ Cross. Plus, he didn’t feel like being stared at by everyone at the station. The boy checked his Hogwarts list once more for good measure, just to ensure he had everything he needed. With a little coaxing, Hedwig hopped into her cage, and Harry checked the lock three times to make sure that she would be fine. He had prepared a shirt in advance to cover Hedwig with, just in case she got uncomfortable with the crowd at Kings’ Cross. For the time remaining, Harry paced his room restlessly, memorising potion ingredients to help with his anxiety. Hedwig cooed the entire time, which helped comfort the boy a little. His companion was very quickly becoming his best friend in the whole wide world. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy, bulky trunk had been loaded into the back of the Dursley’s car, and Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry. Hedwig’s cage sat in between Dudley and Harry, which should’ve helped the situation, but  didn’t because Dudley had tried poking at the cage like he tried to poke the snake’s enclosure at the zoo, and Hedwig had snapped her beaks angrily, threatening the loss of a finger if he came any closer. They reached Kings’ Cross Station at half past ten. Harry would’ve liked it if they had arrived earlier, but Uncle Vernon seemed to have set the GPS to the longest possible route to the station, and honestly, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if that was indeed what the man had done. They all clambered off the car.(Dudley much more reluctantly than everyone else. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind of Uncle Vernon, so he was on full alert just in case his relatives pulled something on him. Just as he expected, there was no way Uncle Vernon would be nice to him just because he was going away for a year. The man stopped dead, a nasty grin on his face. Just ahead of them were platforms nine and ten. “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine— platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?” He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. “Have a good term.” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He turned around, arm around Aunt Petunia’s bony waist, other hand on Dudley’s back. The family walked away, laughing as they dumped behind the child they wish hadn’t been dumped on  them . Harry felt something in his heart clench as his relatives drove away. He might be used to their treatment of him, but some things just didn't stop hurting. Harry glanced at the large clock over the arrivals board. There was no train listed for eleven o’clock, but his letter said quite the opposite. The clock seemed to be taunting him,  tic, tic, tic  , thirteen minutes till departure. Taking a deep breath to compose himself, Harry shoved down his panic and commanded himself into thinking logically. People were starting to stare at Hedwig, so his first order of business was to cover her— he knew that  he wouldn’t like being stared at like that, so why would Hedwig? “Alright,” Harry whispered under his breath, counting  one-two  ,  one-two  to make sure his breaths were even. “Platform nine and three-quarters.” The boy tried his very best to remember if Hagrid had mentioned something, like tapping the third brick from the right or something similar… Briefly, Harry considered taking out his wand and trying every brick along platform nine.  No  , Harry’s mind overruled,  That’s ridiculous and people will think I’m mad . At that moment, a large group passed behind him, and Harry overheard a part of their conversation. “— packed with  Muggles , of course—” Harry turned, eyes bright. The speaker was a middle-aged, plump woman who was talking to four boys, all of which were pushing a cart with a trunk on it. They all had the same flamingly red hair, with slight variations in shade. Most importantly, one of them— the one that looked oldest— had an  owl . Heart hammering in his chest like a great drum, Harry pushed his cart after them, struggling a little with the weight of his textbooks in the trunk. Panting quietly, Harry wondered how the four boys were pushing their carts effortlessly, as if it weighed little more than a feather. Harry hovered on that thought for a moment, coming to the conclusion that there must be some sort of spell to make your things lighter— he put that on his list of top priorities to learn. “Nine and three-quarters!” The youngest chirped, a small girl with long red hair cascading down her back. “Right there!” “Alright,” said the plump woman, a hand on her daughter’s shoulder. “Percy, you go first.” The oldest— Percy— marched onward without hesitation, heading towards platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, forcing his eyes wide so he wouldn’t miss anything— but just as the oldest boy reached the dividing barrier between the platforms, a surge of tourists moved forward. By the time the last backpack cleared, Percy was already gone. Harry blinked. Percy was nowhere on platform nine or ten. He had simply… Vanished. “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. “I’m not Fred, I’m George,” replied a tall, lanky boy. Beside him stood a boy of the same height with the same face. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you  tell that I’m George?” “Sorry, George, dear.”“Only joking, I’m Fred.” said the boy, and off he went. He called after his twin, who Harry supposed must be George. As Harry was busy looking at George, Fred had disappeared, so he made sure to keep a close eye on the remaining twin. This time, he didn’t blink, nor did he look away. The boy approached the barrier briskly, and then quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. There was nothing else to do now. “Excuse me.” said Harry, in his most polite tone. Not that he had a rude one. The plump woman looked up at him with a kind smile, warm eyes trailing over his trunk and the flannel covering the cage-shaped object atop his trunk. “Hello, dear.” The plump woman smiled. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.” She pointed at the youngest of her sons, a tall, thin, gangly kid with an excessive sprinkle of freckles over his nose and cheeks. “Yes,” said Harry, a little nervous now that he wasn’t feeling so panicked. “The thing is— um, you see— the thing is— I… I… I don’t know how to—” “How to get on the platform?” She said kindly, and Harry nodded shyly. “If you could… If you could just point me in the right direction…” “Not to worry, dear.” Her soft smile made Harry’s stomach settle. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” Harry stared at her for a bit. A stranger was telling him to go straight at a wall— in a run. It sounded a little ridiculous, and Harry was worried that Hedwig, who was sleeping, would be jolted out of her slumber if he ran into the wall. “Er… Alright. Thank you, Miss.” Feeling unsure, Harry retrieved Hedwig’s cage so he could carry it under his arm. He turned his trolley and stared at the wall. It looked very much solid, and Harry was willing to bet that it would hurt if he ran into a head-on collision against it. Mustering up some courage, he started walking towards it. People jostled in between him and the barrier, and Harry wondered if some kind of magic was imploring them to block the view of any onlookers. He started to pick up some speed— the barrier was ten meters away— he leaned on his cart and broke into a heavier run— seven meters— would he get scolded by the station security if he caused a commotion?— five meters— he was going too fast now, it would be too late to stop— two meters— now it was less than a foot away— he squeezed his eyes shut to prepare for the crash— The crash that never came. Harry opened his eyes, letting out a breath of relief. That breath of relief quickly changed into one of awe, for the most majestic scarlet steam engine was laying in wait ahead of him, breathing out puffs of smoke like a dragon. Black markings accompanied beautiful, rich red, running along the top and sides of the vessel. Gold marked out the words ‘HOGWARTS EXPRESS’ in bold, and on each train cart were numbers. A sign overhead said ‘ Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock ’. Harry looked behind him and found an iron-framed archway, the words ‘Platform nine and three-quarters’ above it. He had done it. “Don’t stand there,” The oldest boy from earlier— Percy— pulled Harry out of the way. The sudden touch frightened Harry, and he pulled away from the older boy faster than a snake could recoil. “... Sorry if I scared you. But standing in the middle of the archway will cause the next person to hit you head-on.” “Oh,” mumbled Harry, feeling embarrassed. “Sorry.” Percy gave him a weird look. “... Sure. It’s just my job as a prefect, after all. Smoke from the engine wisped up above the heads of the large crowd in platform nine and three quarters. The first few carriages of the train were already packed, and there were people sticking out of windows, talking to their family, and people fighting over seats. Cats of every colour wound in between legs as if they owned the platform, lounging on the steps up to the carriages without a care in the world. Owls hooted at each other in a disgruntled manner over the noise of the engine and the noise of scraping trunks. Harry pushed his cart down the platform, hoping to find a less-packed carriage to spend his journey in. He passed a round-faced boy, who was saying: “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh,  Neville .” sighed the old woman, who was wearing a pale green coat, her hair in a bun and tucked into a lilac beanie-like hat. A boy with dreadlocks was being surrounded by a huge crowd of students, all of which were chanting for him to open the large box he was holding. “Go on, Lee, go on!” The boy grinned and complied, lifting the lid of the box. Screeches were heard as a large hairy, spider-like leg slinkered out of the box. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment around the end of the train. He put Hedwig, who had woken, inside first, muttering a quick apology for rousing her. Taking a deep breath, Harry strengthened his resolve and started tugging and heaving the box towards the train door. He was starting to wish he’d asked the red-haired woman for that spell. He tried over and over again to pull the trunk up the steps, but to no avail. Twice, he dropped it on his foot. “Want a hand?” It was one of the twins he’d followed over the barrier. “Yes please.” Harry panted, thankful that someone had offered. He hadn’t been particularly keen on asking for help. “All you had to do was ask.” grinned the twin, pulling his wand out of his jeans. “ Wingardium leviosa .” The twin pointed his wand at the trunk and flicked it upwards. Sure enough, the trunk started levitating, and using his wand, the redhead guided the trunk into the compartment, tucking it into the corner easily. “ Wingardium leviosa .” Harry breathed, trying to embed the spell into his mind. “Don’t you worry,” The twin grinned. “You’ll learn that spell soon enough. First year syllabus.” “Oi, George,” The other twin had wandered over. “Who’s this?” “Um, Harry.” said Harry as he brushed his sweaty hair off his forehead, “Harry Potter.” The twins gaped at each other, eyes flicking from their identical self to Harry’s forehead. “You’ve really got a lightning-shaped scar!” Harry nodded awkwardly. The twins gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turn red at the attention. They, just like everyone else who he had met so far, treated him like a hero when he really was just an eleven-year-old boy that only survived to be a burden to his relatives. To Harry’s great relief, a familiar voice rang out. “Fred? George? Are you there?” “Coming, Mum!” the twins chorused. With one last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down by the window, half-hidden, and watched the red-haired family with the slightest flame of wanting in his heart. The mother had just taken out her handkerchief and was gesturing for the youngest boy to come to her. “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” The youngest boy tried to pull away, but his mother was faster and already had a grip on his wrist. He jerked and tugged, desperate to get away, but the woman was adamant and rubbed his nose. “Mom—  geroff! ” And he wriggled free. “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins. “Shut up,” replied Ron. “Where’s Percy?” asked the mother. “He’s coming now,” said the other twin. The oldest boy came striding into sight, looking very important with his great, black robes billowing out behind him. His red-and-gold tie was flawless-looking, and Harry noticed that Percy had a badge with ‘ P ’ pinned onto his chest. “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —” “Oh, are you a  prefect , Percy?” said one of the twins with a dramatic air of shock. He pressed one hand to the forehead and pretended to swoon. “You should have said something! We’re family, for Merlin’s sake! We had no idea!” “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once —”“Or twice—” “A minute—” “All summer—” “Oh, shut up.” snapped Percy, face slightly flushed. “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” asked one of the twins, crossing his arms adamantly. “Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “Alright, dear, well, have a good term— send me an owl when you get there.” Percy allowed his mother to kiss him on the cheek with an exasperated sigh, the tips of his ears turning red when the twins swooned at the scene. Soon enough, he was a distant figure, his robes flapping wildly behind him. The mother turned to the twins with a stern look. “Now, you two— this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or—” “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” “It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” “Shut up,” groaned Ron, whose nose was still a little pink from when his mother rubbed it. “Oh hey, Mom, guess who we just met on the train?” Harry leaned back so they wouldn’t see him, just in case Fred or George decided to point him out to their mother. “You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?” “Who?” “ Harry Potter !” Harry heard the girl’s excited voice almost instantly. “Oh,  Mum , can I go on the train and see him, Mum, please—” “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?” “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there— like lightning.” “Poor  dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.” “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?”“I forbid you to ask him, Fred.” Their mother said sternly, and Harry thanked the heavens for the woman. She had just helped him escape what would potentially be a very,  very  awkward conversation. “No,  don’t  you  dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.” “Alright, keep your hair on.”A whistle sounded, and there was a loud clamouring of rushing students as last goodbyes were called out. “Hurry up!” their mother said, ushering them on. The three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.” “ George !” “Only joking, Mom.”The train rumbled to life, stretching its muscles and warming up for the four-hour journey. Harry saw the mother waving and the younger sister, half crying, half running along the side of the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved, still sniffling. Harry watched the mother and the girl until the train went around the bend and he couldn’t see them anymore. There was a wistful feeling in his chest— would his parents see him off like that, too, if they were alive? Would he have had a little sister? Harry liked that second thought— if he had a little sibling, he’d swear on the world that he would protect them to the best of his ability. A twinge of envy stirred inside the boy’s heart. It must be nice to have such a big family, with so many people who cared for you. The door of the compartment slid open, and the youngest redhead stepped in. “Anyone sitting here?” he asked, pointing to the seat opposite of Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. The redhead glanced at Harry, jolted when he met the boy's green gaze, then looked out the window hurriedly as if he hadn’t been staring. The dark-haired child noticed that there was still a smudge of something on Ron’s nose— dust, perhaps?— and contemplated if he should let the other know. “Hey, Ron.” One of the twins peered into the compartment, the other one following closely behind. “Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train— Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” said the other. Ron flinched. “Right.” He mumbled. “Harry,”  This one’s ...Fred? , Harry thought. One of the twins had a more crooked nose than the other, and once Harry took note of that, he could tell them apart. Now he just had to figure out which was which. “Did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother.” “Are you Fred or are you George?” Harry asked politely. The twins looked surprised at his question. “Well—” The one on the left began. “I’m George—” said the right. “And he’s Fred.” The other finished. Harry blinked.“We’ll be going. See you later, then.” winked the one on the right— George? — Fred? Harry wasn’t too sure. “Bye.” said Harry and Ron. The twins closed the compartment door behind them. “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. Clearly, he had been holding himself back, and his restraint had finally broken. Harry nodded, feeling a sense of dread fill him. He had a feeling this wasn’t going to be a conversation he enjoyed. “Oh— well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron lamely. “And have you really got— you know…” He pointed obnoxiously at Harry’s head. Harry shifted, already feeling uneasy and uncomfortable. “Y-Yeah.” he mumbled. “Well— well, do you remember? You-know-who, I mean?” asked Ron eagerly, leaning forward. Harry, by reflex, retreated to compensate for his compartment-mate’s movement, but he was already backed up against his seat and there was nowhere else to go without looking rude. “N-No.” Harry mumbled again, choosing to look at his shoes instead of Ron’s falling face. “W-Well, I…” The flash of disappointment across Ron’s face had triggered something inside him. He let down his relatives practically every day— must he have to let down one of his yearmates even before the school year began? “I remember a flash. A… A flash of g-green light.” “Wow,” breathed Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a moment, abruptly turning back to watch the scenery when he realised what he was doing. Harry was starting to wish he didn’t put  all of his textbooks in his trunk. If he had left one or two of them out, he would at least be able to read to pass the time. Now, all that was left was that suffocating silence that no one knew how to tackle. “So, um,” Ron cleared his throat. Clearly, the silence had gotten to him, and the redhead had become rather restless, shifting in his seat and tapping his foot erratically before stopping abruptly. “I heard that you went to live with Muggles. What are they like?” Harry pondered on his answer for a moment. He didn’t want to go around telling everyone that his relatives were awful— they were still his family, after all. Besides, he couldn’t blame them. He was an investment they never asked for, a burden that got dumped on them. It wasn’t a wonder that they weren’t particularly fond of him, especially when they had to spend so much money on him. Something he was reminded of often enough.“They’re… alright, I suppose,” Harry said, treading carefully with their words. “Um… They… They don’t particularly…  Like me. I… Um, I’m a bit of a burden… They never asked for me… I’m just an extra responsibility for them…” His voice grew smaller and smaller as he carried on. The boy attempted to fold into himself, wanting to curl into a ball and block out the world. The redhead opposite him wasn’t awful, and Harry was sure Ron hadn’t meant to pick up on an uncomfortable topic, but all the dark-haired boy wanted to do now was read and occasionally tell Hedwig an interesting thing he found. Speaking of Hedwig, the snowy owl had been in light slumber. As if she had some sort of magical sixth sense, the owl woke at Harry’s distress, peeking her head out from under her wing. Hedwig cooed softly, wishing she could leave her cage and nuzzle into the boy’s neck to comfort him. Her amber eyes fixed onto Ron and she shot him an angry glare— how dare the redhead upset her Harry! “W-Well,” fumbled Ron. As obnoxious as he could be (sometimes), he wasn’t a complete fool. Signs were flashing from Harry like fireworks on bonfire night, and it didn’t take half a brain to figure out that the emerald-eyed boy was on the verge of a quiet meltdown. “My name’s Ronald Weasley.” Harry paused. Face erupting into a fierce blush, Ron remembered that Harry already knew his name. “And I, uh, I have five brothers. I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to— Bill and Charlie, my oldest brothers, they’ve already graduated. Bill was head boy, and Charlie was quidditch captain. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but even if I do, it’s no big deal, cause they did it first. You never get anything new either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat, grey rat, which was fast asleep. Hedwig hissed. “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff—  I mean , I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think that he had said too much, and returned back to staring outside the window, which made Harry a little sad. He had been a little gloomy earlier, when he was thinking about what a burden he was to the Dursleys— and hearing about Ron’s family had brightened him up. “I wish I had brothers,” said Harry quietly. “I’ve only got one cousin, Dudley, but he… He pushes me around, and he hits me.”“All brothers are like that.” mumbled Ron. Harry thought that Ron was still rather glum, and he thought back to what the redhead had said. Quite easily, he pieced together that Ron’s family wasn’t extremely wealthy or financially well-off— he made a mental note to tread around the topic carefully. “Well,” Harry began, “I’ve been wearing my cousin’s clothes since I was young, too.” This seemed to cheer Ron up, so Harry also told him about not having birthday presents and never getting anything new from his relatives. Whilst they had been talking, the train had launched them through London and into endless meadows. The grasslands stretched on for miles and miles into the horizon, a splat of enormous green for all they could see. The occasional cow would look up as the train passed, completely uninterested before turning back to its infinite buffet of sweet grass blades. Eventually, Harry mustered up the courage to fetch some books from his trunk, crossing his fingers and hoping that Ron wouldn’t instantly label him as a nerd. He carried that title for the entire of his primary life, and it  hadn’t been fun. Granted, having Dudley at the same school didn’t help, either. Ron was a bit appalled that Harry found reading the textbooks interesting, but didn’t say anymore. They conversed lightly, and Harry showcased his multitasking skills when he read his Charms textbook and listened to Ron simultaneously. An hour or so into the journey, Hedwig had fallen back asleep and Ron was getting drowsy. Harry was happily flipping away, having moved on to his Potions textbook. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor that stirred Ron out of his nap. A smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said: “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had breakfast, felt like having something to satiate his stomach would be a good idea for the rest of the ride. He was used to small portions, so he wouldn’t need much to sustain himself. However, he didn’t miss the longing look Ron gave the cart— then he remembered what he had guessed about Ron’s family’s financial situation. “Would you like something?” Harry asked politely.“Ah, it’s alright,” said Ron hurriedly, his smile rather forced. “Mum’s packed lunch for me.” Harry thought that Ron was bloody terrible at hiding his true emotions, but didn’t say anything. He went out into the corridor and smiled politely at the cart lady. “Afternoon, Miss.” He greeted, “Um… What… What do you have?” “Good afternoon, dear.” The cart lady smiled warmly at him, reminding him of the redhead mother at the station. “Well, I’ve got Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes and Licorice Wands, among other things. What would you like?” “Um…” Harry blushed, feeling shy. “What… What would you suggest?” The cart lady eyed him, taking in the bony shoulders, scrawny body, and the thin hands.  Malnourished , was her first thought. “Take these,” she said, handing him a couple of pumpkin pasties. “And take some chocolate frogs, too.” “Oh,” Harry fumbled clumily, arms suddenly filled with the load of food that the lady had given him. “Um… How much would that cost?” “Two sickles, dear.” With a little more struggling, Harry successfully paid the cart lady and thanked her numerous times before heading back inside his compartment. Ron watched with heightened interest as Harry returned, setting the food onto his seat, next to Hedwig. “Want one?” Harry offered, holding a pumpkin pasty out to Ron. The cart lady had given him more than he could eat, and he didn’t like wasting food. “It’s alright,” declined Ron quickly, unwrapping a lumpy package and grimacing when he spotted the dry sandwiches his mother had packed for him. “I’ve got… Ah, I’ve got these… Corned beef sandwiches.” Ron tried to smile, as if corned beef sandwiches were his favourite food in the world— then again, he was a horrible actor, and Harry could see past him like glass. “Have one anyway.” insisted Harry. Eventually, Ron took the pasty from him, looking guilty but pleased at the same time. It was a nice feeling, sharing his food with the boy across him. Harry had never had anything to share before— nor did he have anyone to share anything with. They moved onto the Chocolate Frogs next. Ron explained to Harry that the Frogs came with collectible cards— and that he was only missing Aggripa and Ptolemy. Harry was most amazed to find that Ptolemy, the man he thought was a Greek mathematician— had been a wizard too. The history books at his school hadn’t mentioned a word of magic, so it was all very intriguing. Albus Dumbledore was Harry’s first card, and the old, white-haired man gave Harry the biggest shock of his life when he simply walked out of the card frame, leaving only the background behind. “He’s gone!” Harry stared, unsure if his myopia had gotten worse. “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron as a matter-of-factly. Harry had told him to help himself with the Frogs, and the redhead was testing his luck, crossing his fingers for either Agrippa or Ptolemy. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her… do you want it? You can start collecting.”Harry hummed, turning the card over to read the information there. 

 Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.  

“Huh,” breathed Harry, still feeling rather stunned. “In… In the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded baffled. “ Weird !”They had a great time. Ron chomped down on the Chocolate Frogs while Harry consumed the information on the back of cards. Once in a while, Ron would offer some additional information that wasn’t written, which made for very interesting conversation— at least to Harry, who didn't know very much about the people of the wizarding world. The countryside they had been flying by was now morphing into something wilder. Crops of woodland, spiralling, gushing rivers and formidable mountains flashed past them as they continued travelling over bridges and into tunnels. Ron had fallen asleep again, probably because he had stuffed himself full of pasties and Frogs. His packed sandwiches lay on the seat next to him, long forgotten. There was a knock on their compartment, which made Ron shift and grunt, but didn’t wake him. The round-faced boy Harry glimpsed on the station peered inside, looking tearful. Harry made a motion over his mouth to convey that Ron was asleep. “Sorry,” said the boy in a whisper, voice trembling. “But have you seen a toad?” Harry shook his head with an apologetic look. “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!” sniffled the boy. “You— you’ll find him,” said Harry, reassuringly. He set his Potions textbook down. “Um, if— if you want, I’ll come help you look.” The boy seemed superbly relieved at this, so Harry got up, abandoning his Potions textbook. He spoke softly to Hedwig, who had woken again, just to let her know he was going out for a while. Ron was still asleep, snoring away peacefully with his head leaning against the window in an uncomfortable-looking position. Harry debated on whether or not he should shift Ron into a better position, but elected against it in fear that he would wake the boy. He didn’t think people were typically in good moods if they were woken up abruptly, and he’d rather not risk incurring the wrath of his yearmate. “I’m Harry.” said the emerald-eyed boy, hoping it would smooth over the tension as he slid the compartment door shut behind him. He wasn’t very good at talking to people, but if he had to say so himself, he was doing quite decently. “N-Neville.” responded the boy, who was still tearing up. “We’ll find him.” Harry said, hoping he sounded confident. “W-What’s the name? Of— of your toad?” “T-T-Trevor.” sniffled Neville. “Alright. I— I’ll, um, I’ll do my very best to help you find Trevor. Um… What does… What does he look like?” “H-He’s green, a-and h-he has b-b-brown spots,” said Neville, wiping his eyes desperately. “Um, h-he was a g-gift from my G-Great Uncle A-Algie…” Harry hummed, hoping that the talking would help Neville cool down a little. He didn’t really know what to do when people were crying and he didn’t think it would help if he held Neville in a hug like Aunt Petunia did when Dudley had a tantrum. In fact, he felt that it would only make everything much, much more awkward. “Um— Um, excuse me,” Harry mouthed as he knocked on a compartment. It was empty except for a bushy-haired girl, who was busy getting enraptured in a book. The girl gestured for him to enter, so he did. “S-Sorry to bother you, er… You can get back to your book in a moment… I-I was just wondering i-if you’ve, er, seen a toad? Neville’s lost his.” The girl eyed him. “No, I haven’t seen a toad.” She answered, glancing at the hiccuping Neville behind Harry. “I could help search, though.” “That would be great.” sighed Harry. “I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, and I’m the first witch in my family. My parents were delighted when my letter arrived, of course— and I was ever so pleased to be coming to Hogwarts, it’s the very best school for magic, and I’ve learnt all the course books by heart,  of course—  I do hope that it will be enough— I’ve tried a few of the spells on my own and so far they’ve worked  brilliantly — who are you, by the way?” The girl had spoken so fast that Neville stopped sniffling for a moment, stunned. Harry was very relieved to see that Neville hadn’t learned all the course books by heart, either. “Well, I’m Harry… Harry Potter. And this is Neville… Neville… Er, Neville, what is your last name?” “Longbottom.” mumbled the boy, who, in the light of being stunned by Hermione’s rapid speech, had managed to stop sniffling altogether. Hermione Granger eyed Harry in a way that made him a little uncomfortable. “ Harry Potter  ? I’ve read about you— You’re in  Modern Magical History  and  The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts  and  Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century .” “That…” Harry was a little dazed. “I… I didn’t know I was in books. If… If you don’t mind, c-could I borrow t-those books o-once you’re done? I-I don’t have any other books than the required ones.” This seemed to delight Hermione. “Of course I can!” Then she turned to look a little stern. “You don’t dogear books, do you?” “O-Of course not!” Harry denied, holding his hands up in defense. “I would never.” Just as suddenly, she smiled. “Good. Oh,” She turned to Neville, who was startled at the change in topic of the conversation, “You said you’re a Longbottom? That’s one of the pureblood families, isn’t it?” “Y-Yeah.” Neville looked like he was shrinking into himself, terrified of Hermione’s interrogation. And so the three marched down the train corridor— well, it was more like  Hermione marched on, greeting occupants of compartments with a polite smile, Harry followed behind, and Neville trailed after the two like a lost puppy. By the time they reached the front of the train (which was a long, long way down, as Harry had been seated near the very end), there was still no sight of Trevor. Neville was close to bursting into tears, so Harry patted his back comfortingly, looking very awkward and very out-of-place while Hermione went forward to talk to the train conductor. She reappeared after a moment, looking bright with her jutting front-teeth and bushy hair. “The conductor said we’re nearly there!” She announced happily, expression changing when she eyed Neville’s faded cardigan and Harry’s oversized flannel. “You two better change.” “T-T-Trevor!” Neville wailed. “M-Maybe he’ll turn up later,” Harry suggested helpfully. “And, er, Hermione’s right. We should change.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Ron was in a rather bad mood when Harry returned. Firstly, he was grumpy that Harry had went running off without telling him, and secondly, while Harry had been gone, someone called Malfoy had traipsed into the compartment with his ‘henchmen’ (Ron’s words, not Harry’s), searching for the emerald-eyed boy. There had apparently been a bit of an argument, and Ron had (unfortunately) lost. The highlight of the conflict, however, had been when one of the henchmen tried taking the pastries. Scabber woke at that exact moment, latching onto the henchman’s finger and not letting go even when the boy screamed and flung his hand around. Malfoy, terrified, had run off with his ‘tail between his legs’ (again, Ron’s words). Harry recalled the blonde boy from Madam Malkin’s. It was probably the same boy, thought Harry, and for a moment he wanted to tell Ron about his meeting with the latter in Diagon Alley— but the subject was still a touchy one, plus Harry didn’t want to stir Ron up again. The two changed into their long, black robes, although Ron’s was a bit too short for him, and his sneakers could be seen from under the fraying fabric. Bill— Ron’s oldest brother— was probably not as tall as Ron was at age eleven. The sky outside had turned into a lovely, dark purple, with a sprinkle of pink at the horizon where the sun had shied away. Sprinkles of white decorated the evening skies, curtaining a forest of firs and pines and other flora. Excitement and anxiety bubbled in Harry’s chest, sending a firework of nerves all throughout his little body. A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.” With one last hush of reassurance to Hedwig (Harry wasn’t sure if he was reassuring her or himself), the small boy joined Ron, merging into the churning crowd of students in the train corridor. The train finally slowed to a stop. A great deal of shoving went around as everyone tried to squeeze through the door onto the small, dark platform. Harry shivered as the cold wind brushed past him, laughing mockingly as he pulled his robes closer to himself. Then, out of the darkness, a lamp shone through, bobbing over the sea of heads. “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!”Hagrid’s beaming face towered over the meadow of the students’ hair. “C’mon, follow me— any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down a narrow path, backed on both sides by a dense wall of tall, sturdy trees. Nobody spoke much, with the exception of the occasional grunt when someone slipped. Neville sniffed once or twice. “Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “Jus’ round this bend here.” There was a sudden wave of awe, as the narrow path suddenly opened onto the edge of a large, black lake. Perched regally on a high, sleek hill on the other side, windows sparkling in warm gold, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. Hogwarts took the first years by the head, enchanting them with all of its magnificent glory. “No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, gesturing to a fleet of boats docked by the edge. Harry and Ron clambered into one, followed quickly by Hermione and Neville— the two must’ve regrouped sometime during the unboarding of the train. The redhead looked a little uncomfortable in the company of the eager, confident bushy-haired Hermione and still-sniffling, round-faced Neville, although Harry didn’t mind. Sure, Hermione was a  little overbearing and Neville’s miserable look was a little tiresome, but Harry thought they were nice. “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then— FORWARD!”The fleet of boats moved forward simultaneously at Hagrid’s command, as if they were an orchestra waiting for the conductor’s cue. They glided seamlessly over the lake, which was as smooth as a dark mirror, despite the graceful ripples caused by the little fleet. Everyone was silent with awe as they neared the castle, approaching the shear cliff that it stood upon. It towered over them more and more as they got closer, looking more majestic and intimidating by the second. “Heads down!” boomed Hagrid as the first boats approached the cliff face. A curtain of thick ivy hid the existence of a wide opening in the cliff— an entrance to a neat little cove. A few gasps passed around as they ventured into a water tunnel, lit at the sides by intricate torches. The tunnel seemed to lead them deeper and deeper, into the middle beneath the castle. All of a sudden, the tunnel widened into an underground harbour, surrounded by uneven stone walls and chipped grey stairs. The docking areas were sectioned for individual boats, which all seemed to know where their assigned parking spots were. Hermione was alive with giddiness behind Harry, and he couldn’t help but smile at her excitement. “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was glancing over the boats as people left them. “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. The boy was crying again (this time out of happiness), cuddling his toad while Harry patted his back gently. Hermione provided a glad smile, while Ron simply looked confused. Once the Trevor ordeal was over, they got a move on. They clambered up a long, spiralling passageway, lit with the light of Hagrid’s lamp. At last they emerged from the undergrowth and into the arms of the midnight-blue sky, standing on the soft, rain-graced grass in front of a pair of great doors. “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”Neville nodded happily. Hagrid grinned, even though most people couldn’t see it from under his beard. Then, he raised his gigantic fist and knocked on the oak doors three, steady times. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────



Notes:

We've started diverging from the canon timeline :D I don't know if it's very obvious, but there are some tweaks in Hermione's personality, and I'm sure you already know if you've looked into the tags— Hermione's going to be sorted into Slytherin. I feel like I wrote Neville a little too weepy. What do you think? Currently, I'm a bit conflicted on how I want to take on the next chapter. Obviously, this is when Harry gets sorted, and no big surprise, he's going to end up in Slytherin. I do kind of want to show Snape's perspective on it, but I'm trying to stick to the style of the original book, which is showing things third person from Harry's view. I could do the sorting in Harry's perspective, then have a point of view change to show the whole event from Snape's view again. Thoughts?







Chapter 7: Hour of Judgement


Notes:
Alright if I'm being honest, I'm not very fond of this chapter— I had a great picture of it in my head and I don't think I delivered it well. I don't think I'm particularly proud the bit where Harry gets sorted— but let me know what you think about it! His sorting is one of the most significant events that I've planned, so... Yep. As always, all the greatest thanks to my beta, LadyLuciusConner <3 Enjoy!

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)




Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

The door opened almost instantly, and in the doorway stood a stern-looking witch with her dark hair neatly gathered in a sensible-looking bun. Her hat was artfully tilted at an angle, and her oval-shaped glasses sat on the middle of her slim nose. Harry thought she looked similar to his former Headteacher— she had the aura of someone that should never be crossed. 

“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid with a beam. Harry’s ears pricked at the name— so the woman was the deputy headmistress— the one who wrote the letters to him. 

“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”

Professor McGonagall pulled the great doors open, inviting them into a hall so large that it could fit the Dursleys’ house and still have room. The central piece of the entrance hall was the grand, magnificent marble staircase, which branched off to the two sides of the upper floor. The ceiling was too high to make out, and the walls stretched up and up and up, decorated with billions of portraits, filled with enough people to fill an encyclopedia. With a start, Harry realised that the occupants of the portraits were 

alive

, just like Dumbledore and Morgana and Circe. The painted people stared and gawked at the first years below, making Harry feel like a zoo exhibition. 

They followed Professor McGonagall through the stone-tiled hall. To their right, the chatter of hundreds of students droned on— the rest of the school must’ve arrived already. Instead of leading them into that hall, however, the headmistress in dark green robes led them to a separate, small chamber, in which all the first years crammed into. Everyone peered around nervously, fidgeting and bumping into each other noisily. 

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. The woman didn’t even have to clear her throat for their attention— something about the woman just made you listen, for you didn’t want to find out what the consequences were if you didn’t. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.” 

Someone at the back yawned. However, people like Harry and Hermione, who didn’t come from wizarding households, listened with rapt attention. 

“The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.” 

Hermione nodded vigorously to show that she was listening. 

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all… Smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting,” finished the professor, with a lingering look at Neville’s robes, which were fastened wrongly, and the smudge on Ron’s nose. 

Hermione and Harry, who had both been following the professor’s line of sight, hurried to help Neville fix his attire. The boy was trembling nervously, clutching Trevor so tightly that the frog had turned pale blue from suffocation. “Deep breaths, Neville,” whispered Harry as he righted the fastening of Neville’s robes. Meanwhile, Hermione was busy adjusting the collar. 

“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” 

Harry desperately tried to flatten his hair. “H-Hermione, h-how’s my hair? I-Is it bad? A-Awful?” 

“Do I look like I’d be a good judge of that?” hissed Hermione in return, gesturing to the bushy strands on her head. 

“Y-You two l-l-look g-g-great,” offered Neville, although he wasn’t very convincing. 

“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” Hermione asked, pursing her lips. “I read 

Hogwarts: A History

 but they didn’t mention anything about the sorting.” 

Ron, who had been feeling a little left out of the conversation, piped in with his opinion. “Fred— my brother— said that there was some kind of test. He said it hurt a lot, but I think he was joking.” 

Neville went paler than a sheet of snow.

There came a scoff from behind them. Ron’s eyes narrowed, and he snarled: “

Malfoy

.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous, 

Weasley

,” laughed Draco Malfoy, dressed smartly in his new robes, hair slicked back with some sort of gel. “There’s no sort of silly 

test

.” 

“What is it, then?” Hermione spoke up, not liking the high-and-mighty tone of the blonde. “Since you seem to… Know so much.” 

Not one to like being challenged or questioned so carelessly, Draco instantly narrowed his eyes at the bushy-haired girl. “You’re a muggleborn, aren’t you? It’s pathetic, really. Bet you don’t know a single thing about magic. They shouldn’t even allow people like 

you 

in here.” He turned to face Harry with a snobbish look. “Harry Potter, aren’t you? I was looking for you on the train. You shouldn’t mix with them—” Draco gave Ron a pointed look. “They’re blood traitors, always slobbering after the muggles.” 

Ron’s jaw tightened. 

“And her?” Draco laughed mockingly at Hermione. “She’s even worse. Worse than the blood traitors! Muggles— they know 

nothing

.” 

“Well…” The feeling that filled Harry at Diagon Alley— when Draco mocked Hagrid— surged through him again. He could feel something tingling at his fingertips, and beneath the surface, a great, powerful monster was stirring under the sea level. “If she’s a muggleborn, I’m one too.” 

Draco flushed. 

“And,” Harry continued, unsure where this sudden bout of courage was coming from. “I think she knows more about Hogwarts than you do. Hermione—” The girl perked up. “When was Hogwarts built?” 

“Around 990 A.D.” answered the bushy-haired girl without hesitation. 

“How many staircases does it have?” 

“A hundred and forty-two.” 

“— And yet, none of you know how the Sorting is going to happen,” interrupted Draco, crossing his arms. 

Then, to everyone’s surprise— 

“I-I-I know.” mumbled Neville, who everyone had forgotten about up to that point. “G-Gran said that t-they j-just p-p-put a hat on you.” 

Draco blinked. 

Before the blonde could retort, however, there came a scream from the back of the room. Harry jumped about a foot into the air, much to Hermione’s bewilderment. A sea of gasps rushed over the room as twenty near-transparent figures floated through the room, phasing through walls perfectly fine. They seemed to be arguing as they glided over the room, paying no attention to the gaping first years. 

A fat little monk was speaking: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—” 

“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?” replied another ghost irritatedly. “He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost— I say, what are you all doing here?” 

Nobody answered. 

“New students!” said the Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”

“Yes, sir,” replied Hermione brightly. She had gotten over the initial shock rather quickly. 

“Y-Yes,” echoed Harry with a shy smile. 

“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff, then!” beamed the Friar at the two. “My old house, you see.” 

“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.” 

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts phased through the opposite wall, going off elsewhere to haunt the castle, although Harry wasn’t sure if it could really be called a haunting if the ghosts weren’t purposely scaring anyone. 

“Now, form a line,” said Professor McGonagall, adjusting her oval glasses. “And follow me.” 

Although Harry felt a little relieved knowing there was no ‘test’, his anxiety was still shooting off the charts, rocketing around his body like a pinball. His legs felt heavier than lead, making it strenuous for him to get in line behind Hermione, who was vibrating with excitement and Ron, who looked as if he were going to puke. Neville, in front of Hermione, was shaking in fear. Harry felt like a combination of all three. 

Once they were in line, Professor McGonagall led them back into the entrance hall and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. It was so much more magical than anything Harry had ever seen. Thousands and thousands of candles floated midair, giving the entire hall its warm, fire-lit glow. Four long, long tables were packed with students, with each table’s students wearing a particular colour— red, yellow, green, and blue. Gold plates and goblets were arranged neatly on all the tables, void of food for the time being. 

Up ahead was a long table, made perpendicular to the rest of the houses’ tables. The staff were seated here, at the raised podium. Professor McGonagall led them up front so that they stood in a line, facing the students with the teachers behind them. Hundreds and hundreds of curious and bored faces stared at them, and dotted among these faces were the misty silver silhouettes of the ghosts, who had come to join the start-of-term ceremony. 

To avoid the stares of his future schoolmates, Harry looked upward and observed the ceiling, which was bewitched to look like the night sky outside. This information was very kindly provided by Hermione, who was churning out random facts like butter. Harry wasn’t sure if she was doing so to calm herself, or if she was just excited. Either way, her talking calmed 

him 

down, so he wasn’t complaining. 

Harry looked back down as Professor McGonagall set down a four-legged stool, and on top of the stool, she placed an extremely old-looking wizard’s hat. It had holes all over, some of which had been patched with mismatched pieces of cloth. 


This must be the hat Neville talked about

, thought Harry. 

Everyone in the hall stared at the hat, including the first years. There was a very tense moment— and then the hat 

twitched

. It moved. It got itself comfortable on the stool, and a rip on the hat opened wide— to Harry’s amazement, the hat began to 

sing

! 


“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, but don’t judge on what you see, 



I’ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me. 



You can keep your bowlers black, your top hats sleek and tall, 



For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat and I can cap them all. 



There’s nothing hidden in your head the Sorting Hat can’t see, 



So try me on and I will tell you where you ought to be. 



You might belong in Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart, 



Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart; 



You might belong in Hufflepuff, where they are just and loyal, 



Those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil; 



Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, 



Where those of wit and learning, will always find their kind; 



Or perhaps in Slytherin you’ll make your real friends, 



Those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends. 



So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! 



You’re in safe hands (though I have none) for I’m a Thinking Cap!” 


The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It grinned widely and bowed to each of the four tables, grin widening when someone called for an encore. Just as abruptly as it came to life, the hat became still again. 

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. “When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said, clearing her throat. “Abbott, Hannah!”

A pig-tailed girl separated herself from the cluster of first years and nervously approached the stool, not knowing what to expect. Professor McGonagall lifted the hat and placed it on Hannah’s head after she had sat down. The brim of the hat covered half of Hannah’s face, and the hall was breathless, on the edge of their seats— 

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. 

The table of yellow-scarved students cheered and applauded as a blushing Hannah approached them, welcoming their new addition with open arms. Harry watched with amazement as the collar, tie, and lining of Hannah’s robes became yellow, just like the colour of a wasp, the moment she touched her house table. The ghost of the Fat Friar waved merrily to Hannah as she sat down. 

“Bones, Susan!” 

“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. 

“Boot, Terry!” 

“RAVENCLAW!” 

The table with students in blue ties clapped warmly as Terry grinned and rushed to join his housemates— a few of them even got up to shake hands with the boy. 

‘Brocklehurst, Mandy’ became a Ravenclaw, too, but ‘Brown, Lavender’ was the first Gryffindor of the 1991 batch. The table of red robes clapped, and a few wolf-whistles erupted much to Professor McGonagall’s displeasure. Lavender, who blushed happily, didn’t seem to mind too much, however. 

‘Bulstrode, Millicent’ was a Slytherin, and Harry couldn’t help but be a little scared of her. The girl looked strong enough to knock out 

Dudley 

with one punch, so Harry didn’t really want to know how much damage she could do to 

him

. 

Harry was starting to feel a little sick now. He remembered always being picked last for sports teams— what if the hat rejected him and ordered for him to be placed in whichever house had the least new students? And what if none of the houses wanted him? He remembered the hat announcing the qualities for the houses— brave, loyal, smart, and cunning— he didn’t feel like either of those qualities. If there was a house for those that were a little queasy, that would be the house for him. 

“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” 

“HUFFLEPUFF!” 

Sometimes, Harry noted, the hat took a little longer to decide. Sometimes, it decided as soon as it touched a strand of hair from the student. ‘Finnigan, Seamus’ was on the stool for a whole minute before the hat called out “GRYFFINDOR!”. What if Harry took ten minutes? He didn’t think he’d ever be able to live down that kind of embarrassment. 

“Granger, Hermione!” 

Harry had to stifle a laugh as Hermione literally ran to the stool and jammed the hat on her head. 

“...” The hat paused. Then, it seemed to smirk before opening its mouth and announcing, for the whole hall to hear: “SLYTHERIN!” 

Behind Harry, Ron pumped his fist into the air and Draco groaned, face-palming. 

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re nervous— and Harry was feeling very, very, 

very 

nervous. What if he sat there for the longest time and the hat just decided he wasn’t good enough for 

any 

house? What if Professor McGonagall just came up to him and snatched the hat off his head and told him he was better off pursuing a Muggle education, that he should hurry if he wanted to catch the train home? 

When it was Neville’s turn, Harry tore himself away from his awful speculations to support the boy who was probably just as nervous (if not more) as he was. He gave Neville a thumbs up and winced when the boy tripped and fell flat on his face on his way to the stool. Once the hat was on Neville’s head, it mumbled, occasionally saying something like ‘hmm… 

interesting

…’. When it finally shouted: “GRYFFINDOR!”, Neville was so elated that he ran off with the hat, and had to backtrack to give it to MacDougal, Isobel. 

‘Macmillan, Ernie,’ became a Hufflepuff, and after him Draco Malfoy swaggered up onto the platform, looking as proud as he could be. For a moment, Harry envied him— if only he could be half as confident as Draco was. The sorting hat had barely touched a blonde hair on Malfoy's head before it hollered: “SLYTHERIN!” 

Looking pleased, Draco went off to join Crabbe and Goyle at the Slytherin table. 

There weren’t many people left now— “Malone,”... “Moon,”... “Nott,”, then a pair of twins, “Patil,” and “Patil,”— then “Perks,” and at long last— 

“Potter, Harry!”

As Harry stepped forward, whispers broke out like sprinklers in a building where a fire alarm had just broken out. Every pair of eyes were on him— even those that had looked bored before had perked up in interest, picking him apart with their vulture-like gazes. He swallowed thickly. The distance between him and the stool— he knew, logically, it was only two meters away— but it felt like a mile. 

“

Potter

, did she say?”

“

Harry Potter

?” 

“

The 

Harry Potter?” 

Professor McGonagall had an unreadable expression as she patiently gestured for him to sit. If he had to describe the look in her eyes, however— recognition, regret, and 

remorse

. Hesitance lingered in his muscles as Harry sat on the stool, forced to see the whole school craning their heads to get a good look at him, as if he were some animal to be gawked at. Everything went black after that, and he realised he was looking at the inside of the hat. 

“

Hmm,

” said a voice inside his head. Harry realised that the Sorting Hat was speaking to 

him

, and that the rest of the hall was not privy to the conversation. “

Difficult. Yes, yes… Quite difficult. Cautious… Calculating… And clever, too. Very instinctive… But brave, too. Plenty of courage… Not a bad mind… Rather observant… There’s talent, and a need for achievement— satisfaction. Now, now… This is interesting. Where shall I put you?

” 


Somewhere I won’t be gawked at

. Harry hadn’t meant to think that, but the Sorting Hat had caught wind of his thought, and it was too late to turn back. 

“

Somewhere you won’t be gawked at?

” chuckled the Sorting Hat, amused. “

This won’t be a popular decision, I suppose… But you could find a home among the snakes, no?

” 

Harry was quiet for a moment. “

Will I?

” 

“

I guess we’ll find out

.” mused the Sorting Hat. 

“

If— if I may ask a question, Mr. Sorting Hat?

” 

“

I suppose we could make time for that. Go ahead.

” 

“

What… What houses were my parents in?

” 

“

Gryffindor— both of them. But I suppose the question you really want to ask— would they be proud of you if you got sorted into Slytherin?

” 

“...” 

“

Now, I only knew your parents for a grand total of three minutes, so you’re better off asking someone who actually knew them— but here’s the thing, child. Does it matter what they think?

” 

“

... Well, they’re dead

.” 

“

Quite

.” 

“

I suppose it doesn’t

.”

“

No, I suppose not. What matters the most, perhaps, is what you think of it

.” 

“

... Slytherin… It isn’t all evil, is it?

” 

“

What do you think?

” 

“

... No.

” 

“

Slytherin doesn’t make people evil, child. People make themselves evil.

” 

“... 

I see

.” 
“I think we’ve taken up enough time here, don’t you think? You’ve got a brilliant mind, Harry Potter— very brilliant indeed. You’ve got all the qualities of a Slytherin— you’re cautious, and you weigh consequences before you make decisions. But above that, Harry— you have a good heart. Don’t let anything destroy that.” 
“

I won’t, Mr. Sorting Hat. It was nice talking to you

.” 

“

And vice versa, Harry Potter

— SLYTHERIN!” 

Harry heard the last word yelled out for the whole of the great hall to hear. No applause awaited him, however. The hat slipped off of his head, leaving the boy-who-lived to face a sea of judgement all by himself. Even Professor McGonagall, behind him, was frozen in shock— and he didn’t need to turn around to feel her disappointed gaze. Somewhere further behind Harry, at the head table, someone spluttered and choked on their tea. 

Harry swallowed. When the Sorting Hat said that it wouldn’t be a popular decision— that was an 

understatement

. 

The silence was broken by an onslaught of whispers, shattering as if someone had chucked a javelin at a sheet of glass. Shrewd looks were cast at him, thrown towards him like spears. Insensitive commentary jabbed at him like a thousand knives. Disgusted glances flew at him like a bombardment of arrows. Harry Potter stood alone against an army of discrimination, facing an entire regiment head-on with no defence and no one at his side. 

“What? The boy-who-lived in 

Slytherin

?” 

“

Harry Potter

? A 

Slytherin

?” 

“My ma always said it took dark magic to defeat dark magic…” 

It was pathetic, but Harry felt ready to burst into tears. Perhaps it would’ve been better if he was unsorted and Professor McGonagall told him he had to go back to the Dursleys… 

Then, amid all the judgemental whispers and the doubtful gazes, someone started clapping. Hermione, in her now-green robes, had stood up from the Slytherin table. She wore a determined expression as she continued clapping, blatantly ignorant of how three-quarters of the school was gaping at her. 

To just about everyone’s surprise, claps started coming from the Gryffindor table, too. Neville stood up, shaking slightly, trying his very best not to meet the bewildered gazes of his fellow housemates. 

Things only escalated from there. Shock coloured Harry’s face as the entire Slytherin table stood and applauded, cheering and welcoming their new snake with open arms. The rest of the school still stared, appalled— but that didn’t deter them at all. A few of the green-decked students even went as far as to shoot glares at the other houses for giving such terrible treatment to the eleven-year-old boy. 

“

Sonorous!

” yelled one of the older years, amplifying the cheers of the Slytherin table by tenfold. Soon enough, all the Slytherins capable of casting the spell were doing so, multiplying the volume over and over and over again, crashing over the criticism of three-quarters of the school.

Anyone outside the hall would’ve thought that an explosion had taken place, for the amplitude of the cheers was sky-high and still climbing into the promise of outer space. The castle itself shook from the sound, vibrations carried through the walls and floors. Slytherin took Hogwarts by storm, refusing to let the rest of the school make one of their own cry on his very first day. 

Hell, Draco Malfoy was clapping— granted, he had a fierce scowl on his face, but he was clapping nonetheless. 

Flushing, Harry unfroze himself and stepped down from the podium, stumbling over to the Slytherin table. Hermione had leapt off of her bench, rushing over to the front of the table to intercept a shaking Harry, enveloping him in a hug so tight that he couldn’t breathe for a bit. She gripped his wrist in hers, tugging him towards her seat at the table. All around, Slytherins sent him warm, polite smiles, clapping his back and ushering welcomes. 

A home among the snakes, indeed. 

Any lingering gazes from the neighbouring tables were quickly scared away by Harry’s housemates, who glared and carried threats in their eyes. Further down the table, there was a prefect hissing: “Put your wand 

down

, you 

idiot

, don’t cause a scene! Do you want to be skinned alive by Snape?” 

Professor McGonagall cleared her throat, regaining her professionalism. ‘Thomas, Dean’, a boy even taller than Ron— (Harry felt a twinge of envy. Compared to everyone else he was 

tiny

)— was sorted into Gryffindor, greeted by a rather awkward applause. ‘Turpin, Lisa’ was welcomed at the Ravenclaw table in the same manner, as everyone was still a bit off their stable footing after Harry’s unexpected sorting. 

“Your sorting was nearly a hatstall, you know.” A silvery-blonde girl told him rather breezily. She sat opposite him, and next to her was a brunette who looked uninterested in the entire affair. Hermione was at his right, and Malfoy looked constipated at the sight of her. The blonde pureblood child was trying his very best to be as close to Harry but as far as Hermione as possible, which was difficult, as the two were practically stuck together. 

“Oh,” responded Harry, feeling a little stupid. “Uh… What’s a hatstall?” 

The brunette rolled her eyes. “It’s when the Sorting Hat takes longer than five minutes to decide on your house.” 

Humming, the silvery-blonde girl held up a pocket watch, delicately decorated with an arc of constellations, each made carefully from a paper-thin slice of metal. Small planets orbited the ends of the clock’s hands, ticking every time they fulfilled a circle. “Four minutes forty-six seconds.” The girl told him helpfully. “Daphne Greengrass, by the way.” 

“Harry,” replied the boy by reflex. 

“Oh, we know who you are.” said the brunette dryly. “In fact, the entire school knows.” 

Harry blushed, and Daphne elbowed the brunette lightly. 

“Tracey Davis,” said the brunette, ignoring Daphne’s dig at her torso. “Halfblood.” 

“Tracey!” admonished Daphne, looking scandalised. “You didn’t have to say that!” 

“No, I had to.” Tracey turned to stare Harry dead in the eyes. “I want him to know from the get-go. If you don’t want to be friends with a 

filthy halfblood like me, Potter

—” 

“H-Hold on,” stammered Harry, feeling very overwhelmed and confused. Why was Tracey staring at him so fiercely? “W… What is a 

halfblood

?” 

Both Daphne and Tracey blinked, mouths dropping into a gape. Beside them, a not-so-secretly eavesdropping Malfoy looked at Harry like he was the stupidest person the blonde had ever come across. 

“Y… You don’t know what a halfblood is?” Daphne said slowly, as if she were still trying to comprehend the matter herself. 

“Y… Yeah?” Harry said, equally confused. He risked a glance at Hermione, who looked just as lost as he felt. “Hermione?” 

“No idea.” For once, there was something the girl didn’t know. Harry couldn’t really tell what the bushy-haired Slytherin was thinking, but it was probably along the lines of 

library

, 

books

, and 

research

. Harry made a mental checklist, and at the top of that list was ‘Tell Hermione to bring me along when she goes to the library for research,’. 

“Well,” Daphne cleared her throat, straightening her back and adjusting her facial expression. Somewhere in the noise behind them, a very green Ronald Weasley had just been sorted to Gryffindor. “You know how some students have… Muggle parents? Such as Granger herself.” 

Harry and Hermione nodded simultaneously, both equally captivated with Daphne’s explanation. 

“Granger is… Er… What 

some 

wizards and witches would call a 

Mudblood

. It’s… A derogatory term. Basically, a lot of pureblood families think that wizards and witches of Muggle descent are unworthy of magic.” Daphne continued, looking uncomfortable as broaching a subject that graced Hermione so closely. “Some other wizards and witches, like 

you

, 

Harry

, have one muggleborn parent and one pureblood parent. You’re a half-and-half, so they call you a halfblood.” 

Harry had a feeling that when Daphne emphasized on the ‘

you

’ and the ‘

Harry

’, the girl was indicating to her brown-haired friend that the boy-who-lived was of the same blood status. 

“Purebloods consider everyone who 

isn’t 

a pureblood unworthy of their 

holy presence

.” snorted Tracey, her sharp eyes trailing over to Draco, who couldn’t help but flinch. “Isn’t that right, 

Malfoy

?” 

“Not all purebloods think that way,” corrected Daphne with a brief look at the other. “Er… A lot of pureblood families can be… Prejudiced in their thinking.” She said slowly, her eyes fixed on Draco’s reaction. “And… A 

lot 

of pureblood families— especially those with the, er, 

traditional 

thinking— are sorted into Slytherin. Just a word of warning. If you hear anyone calling you a mudblood or a halfblood like it's an insult— ignore them.” 

Harry nodded. 

“Oh, and Draco,” Daphne said politely, with a sweet smile as her sea-green gaze pinpointed onto him. “I understand if you’d like to write to your parents to cancel our 

engagement

 after the… Ah, contents of tonight’s conversation with our new fellow Slytherins.” 

Something about the way Daphne smiled reminded Harry of a coiled snake, prepared to strike. It was at that exact moment Harry understood why Slytherins were labelled ‘cunning’ and ‘sly’— Daphne was the perfect example of both at the moment. She was outrightly challenging the blonde all while maintaining her grace and manners, never a hair out of place. 

Draco mumbled something incoherent. 

“Y-You know,” Harry piped in shyly, “Um, I’m sorry about what happened just now, before the sorting.” The three girls’ gazes were pinned on him— Harry was trying very, very hard to ignore them or he was going to break down nervously. “I’d love to be friends if you aren’t mean to Hermione and the rest.” 

The blonde eyed him in distaste, eyes flickering to where Hermione wore an expressionless mask, to where Daphne sent him a challenge within her gaze, to where Tracey eyed him like she’d rather be anywhere else than next to him. Like a true snake, Draco weighed his options— if he took up Harry’s offer, he’d also have to face the three girls, all of which looked ready to attack him at moments’ notice— but if he took up Harry’s offer, he could also write to his father, and he knew without a doubt the man would be pleased. 

“... Fine.” Draco grumbled. “Move over, Greengrass.” 

The silvery-blonde girl complied, ushering Tracey over so that they could make space for Draco. Hermione still eyed him warily, and Tracey still looked like she wanted to pick him apart and feed him to crows, but the thankful look in Harry made up for the other looks being thrown to him. 

… What? 

Draco tried not to let his panic show on his face. There was a warm something buzzing in his chest, something growing an expanding under his ribcage— and was that all because of that one, stupid smile that Potter shot him? The pureblood boy risked a glance at Harry’s face again, and found himself drawn in by those stupidly green eyes. A gentle, shy smile was waltzing softly along Harry’s lips, and for some reason, it was making Draco’s heart race. Should he go find his godfather and demand for the man to do a medical checkup? 

“SLYTHERIN!” 

The five students looked up to see the last student— Zabini— sorted. The dark-skinned boy was clearly raised in a pureblood family, too— his posture and poise spoke for that, even if his brand-new robes didn’t. 

“Mind if I sit?” asked Zabini politely, one hand on the table as green slipped onto his robes. “I’m Blaise of the House Zabini, by the way.” 

“Of course not!” beamed Hermione, moving over to make space. 

“Hey, room for one more?” A Slytherin first-year had slipped down the table towards where they were currently occupying, a soft smile on his lips. 

“Hello, Theodore,” smiled Daphne in return. “I guess we could still make room.” 

“Potter, you’re a damn magnet,” commented Tracey wryly. “Let’s be honest, half of you lot are here because your family will be more than delighted if they receive letters this weekend with the contents ‘I’m friends with bloody Potter’.” 

Draco, Blaise, and Theodore all shrugged, neither denying or clarifying the truth. 

“Expected,” said Daphne airily. 

Draco shot Greengrass a look. “You know what it’s like.” 

“Yes, I do,” she responded coolly. “But at least I’m not here just for gossip on a letter.” 

This made Malfoy flush— whether in anger or embarrassment was up for debate. 

“Welcome,” said Albus Dumbledore, cutting out whatever retort Draco Malfoy was going to give to his potential wife. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!” 

Harry blinked. 

“Is… Is he a bit mad?” He asked uncertainty. Or was ‘Nitwit, blubber, oddment, tweak’ some sort of wizarding slang he had no idea about? 
“Yes,” answered five students in unison. Hermione, by his side, looked flabbergasted that the man in question was their headmaster, but simply out of respect, did not say anything more. 
“And not just 

a bit 

mad, Potter,” Theodore added dryly. “

Very much 

mad.” 

“He’s one of the most powerful wizards alive, isn’t he?” Hermione asked, looking doubtful. There was no question that she was eyeing Dumbledore’s lovely purple robes, dotted with broomsticks and crooked hats. The ensemble came with a matching hat, which Dumbledore was very happily wearing. “Responsible for the defeat of Grindelwald?” 

The other Slytherins shared a few glances. 

“He… Might’ve 

been

 the most powerful wizard alive,” answered Blaise slowly. 

“You might want to drop the harping on Dumbledore, 

Granger

,” sneered Malfoy, a complete difference from Blaise’s careful tone. “He’s—”

“Malfoy,” warned Daphne. 

“Malfoy’s right, in a way, though,” Tracey sighed. “Look, Hermione, you look like the kind of person that’s going to go around school with the sole goal of being every teacher’s favourite student. News flash, might as well drop that dream before it crashes into pieces, alright? It’s no secret that Slytherin isn’t exactly Dumbledore’s favourite house. Heck, it isn’t 

anyone’s 

favourite house, excluding the Slytherins themselves.” 

Hermione looked like she wanted to say something in argument, but closed her mouth thoughtfully. “Not very unbiased, is he?” 

A chorus of snorts went around. “No, not at all.” 

“Potato, Harry?” Blaise said out of nowhere, and it was with a start that Harry realised that the plates in front of them had miraculously been filled with food. 

Harry’s mouth dropped open in a wide gape. He had never seen so much food in his entire life. A quick glance told him that the rest of the Slytherin table— as well as the tables of the other houses— were also laden, thick with delicious, steamy food, fresh from the kitchen. There was ham, potatoes, chicken, cake, salads— everything Harry could ever dream of. 

With a mental note to pace his bites as not to overwhelm himself with food— Harry wasn’t very keen on vomiting in his very first night at Hogwarts— he took little bits of food and placed them on his plate, watching the table manners of the other students and following as closely as he could. 

Engrossed with his food, Harry didn’t notice until Draco jumped and rattled the whole table that there was a ghost seated next to the blonde, who didn’t look very comfortable with the seating arrangements. The ghost had a blank, gaunt face, his robes dripped with a silvery substance that Harry suspected was once 

blood

 before it was… ghost-ified.

“... Good evening,” Harry addressed the spirit politely, deciding that it was only right to greet someone, whether they were alive or dead. Draco gave him a look that very clearly conveyed the ‘

Are you mad?

’ message. 

The ghost dipped his head in response. Harry took that as an indicator that the ghost wasn’t very keen on verbal conversation, and minimised things to a polite nod in reply. Beside him, Hermione and Daphne were happily engaged in a conversation ranging from pureblood manners and traditions to academics, which escalated into the subjects they wanted to take in their NEWT exams, once Daphne had explained the NEWTS to a very eager, preening Hermione. Theodore had given his input once or twice, listening to the conversation more than partaking in it. 

Harry had a friendly little chat with Blaise, who gave off a very warm, steady aura. Somewhere through the feast, Tracey, tired of being caught between the academic-inclined-students’ conversation, had switched places with Daphne to join the discussion between Blaise and Harry. The halfblood boy had minimal knowledge about the wizarding world, so Blaise and Tracey— two who had grown in the grasps of magic— took it upon themselves to educate Harry. Draco, who interrupted Tracey a few times, quickly learned his lesson when the brunette straight-up 

bristled 

at him. 

As desserts were served, the conversation turned towards families, and the three who were talking about their NEWTS rejoined the others. 

“I’m a halfblood, like I said before,” shrugged Tracey, “Mum’s a witch, Dad’s a muggle. He didn’t know until I started showing my first signs of accidental magic— I was two, I think. Was quite a shock for him, according to what Mum said. He was a bit mad that she never told him, but was pretty fine with it after that. We moved to London after— there were lots of job opportunities there for both my Mum and Dad. Been there since. What about you, Hermione?” 

The witch brightened when it was her turn. “Oh! I live in Northern London— in Hampstead! Perhaps we could visit each other sometime.” 

Tracey shrugged, a hint of a smile on her lips. “Sure.” 

“My parents are dentists— both of them! They’ve got their own clinic in London,” continued Hermione excitedly. 

“What in Merlin’s name is a dentist?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Some sort of weird profession only Muggles do, I bet.” 

“

Draco

.” There came Daphne’s warning again— she seemed to be perfectly capable of keeping the blonde in place. Harry’s respect for her was growing exponentially. 

A little of Hermione’s brightness had faded after the blonde’s remark. She faltered slightly, as if suddenly realising that her parents might not be as interesting as everyone else’s— especially if more than half of them came from noble families that practically ruled over small areas of Britain. 

“I’ve never been to a dentist before,” Harry piped up unexpectedly, “But they’re basically doctors that look at your teeth. They can fix your teeth, too, if it’s broken— sometimes they take the tooth out if it’s too bad. Is that right, Hermione?” 

The girl stared at him for a moment before smiling again, a soft twinkle in her eyes— an unspoken 

thanks

. “Yeah. They can take out teeth if it gets too bad. I was never allowed many sweets as a kid.” 

“That sucks,” Theodore hummed. 

Hermione shrugged. “They’re great, though.” 

The conversation continued flowing nicely, although an intervention was required when Draco kept going on and on and on about all the great things his father bought him throughout the year. Every Slytherin in Malfoy’s vicinity were either rolling their eyes or using the last of their self-discipline to keep a straight, polite face. Thankfully, Daphne cut his speech short with a: “

Thank you, 

Draco, that was a very informative session about your family, Tracey, would you like to go next?” 

Harry, who was starting to feel sleepy, glanced up at the head table to get a look at his teachers. Hagrid had taken a large swig from his goblet, Professor McGonagall was talking to the headmaster, and Professor Quirrell, in his Petunia-would-love-that-colour-for-curtains turban, was talking to a hook-nosed professor who looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. 

The hook-nosed professor glanced past Professor Quirrel’s turban and straight at Harry with a strange, conflicted look in his eyes. The next thing Harry knew— there was a sharp pain shooting through his scar, making his hands fly up by instinct. 

“Is something wrong?” Theodore raised an eyebrow at the sudden display. 

“N-Nothing,” said Harry, feeling uneasy and very wide awake now. The pain was already ebbing away. It had been a small sting, as if someone had taken a thin, metal whip and hit him on his forehead— quite a difference from the broad-spreading pain from Uncle Vernon’s thick belt. “Um… W-Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrel?” 

The Slytherins glanced up. 

“Oh, that’s Professor Snape. Our ol’ dungeon bat. He went to school with my Mum,” answered Tracey. 

“He’s also—” Draco opened his mouth, looking incredibly cocky and proud before Theodore cut him off. 

“Your godfather, we know, Draco. You’ve told us about a million times now,” Theodore sighed. 

“He’s our head of house,” Daphne offered, “He teaches potions. He looks quite intimidating, I know— but don’t worry about it. Professor Snape, as odd as it sounds, looks after us, his Slytherins, quite well. He isn’t easy to approach, but he’s reliable and fair. He’s also the only professor in this entire building on our side— Slytherins aren’t… Well, we’re not the favourites.” 

At last the desserts were cleared up, and Dumbledore got to his feet. The hall fell silent. 

“Ahem— just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” He winked in the direction of the Weasley twins, who winked back. “I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” 

Very few people laughed. Harry was not one of them. There was something in the headmaster’s tone that told him he was very, 

very 

serious. Determined to do well at school now that Dudley wasn’t around to rip his homework and lie to the teachers, Harry swore to avoid the third floor corridor like a bloody plague. 

“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” announced Dumbledore jovially. Harry’s eyes flitted to the other teachers at the table, noticing that their expressions had become rather fixed. He risked a glance at his head of house— the man looked like he was grimacing. Huh. 

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, and when nothing came out he squinted at his wand questioningly. This made a few people laugh. He flicked it a second time, and much to Harry’s awe, a long, golden ribbon swooped out from the tip of his wand, weaving itself into words that floated above in the Great Hall.

“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “And off we go!” 

“

Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, teach us something please. Whether we be old and bald, or young with scabby knees, our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff. For now they’re bare and full of air, dead flies and bits of fluff, so teach us things worth knowing. Bring back what we’ve forgot, just do your best, we’ll do the rest, and learn until our brains all rot.

” sung the school. It sounded very chaotic— everyone was singing a different tune, after all. Harry, who was completely tone-deaf, smiled, feeling happy for the first time in a long time, murmuring the words under his breath. 

Everyone finished the song at different times. At last, it was just the Weasley twins, singing to a slow, solemn funeral march. The headmaster conducted their last few lines with his wand, and when they were finally done, he was one of the few who clapped the loudest. 

“Ah, music,” He said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”

“Alright, first years!” One of the fifth years— Gemma Farley, with a prefect badge just like Percy’s but in green and silver, directed over all the noise. She was one of those people born with a responsible-looking face, with her clear brown eyes and neatly-braided hazel hair. “First years, with me!” 

Like a flock of sheep, the first years trailed after Gemma. A few other students Harry didn’t talk to at the feast joined them— Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe. They were led into the depths of the castle, descending when the other houses ascended. The air got chillier and colder as they marched on into stone walls and corridors untouched by sunlight. 

Harry was very surprised to see that some stone ‘walls’ shifted aside for them to pass through. If he had to take a guess, the confusing route and similar-looking corridors were to confuse other houses from finding their way down to Slytherin quarters, but he wondered about the effectiveness of that if he 

himself 

couldn’t find his way to his own quarters. 

Eventually they came to a halt in front of a stone archway. In the middle of the archway was a large door— larger than the ones at the Dursley household, anyway. Curled up on the door was a great, silver snake, carved with extraordinary detail. The eyes of the silver snake were embedded with diamond-shaped emeralds, glinting coldly under the light of the fire torches. 

Gemma hid a smile when she noticed the first years’ curiosity. With one hand, she reached out to gently stroke the smooth, scaled back of the silver serpent. Shrieks broke out from the young crowd when the snake shifted, twisting its body so that its head was now parallel to the floor, widening its jaws slowly until a silver filament reached out and flickered like the tongue of a 

real 

snake. 

The silver snake hissed softly at Gemma. 

“Pride and prejudice,” she responded calmly, despite having the head of a snake about the size of a football mere inches away from her face. 

Nodding approvingly, the snake slipped back onto its frozen position on the door and let it click open, granting them entry. An array of gasps coursed through the first years as they entered the Slytherin common room, illuminated with green light that slithered through the large, clear, glass windows giving them an unlimited view of the Black Lake. 

“This is the Slytherin common room,” said Gemma, unable to resist a smile as the flock of curious firsties glanced around wildly. “The password currently is 

pride and prejudice

. Once a fortnight, the passwords will be changed and the new one will be posted on the notice board. Either you remember to check it or you’re stuck outside. If you’re lucky, one of your fellow Slytherins might come along and help you in.” 

She paused. 

“As you saw just now, the castle walls slid and moved around as we were coming down. That’s the work of the castle— it prevents other students from finding their way down here. As long as you don’t bring a student from a different house with you, the castle will guide you to the Slytherin quarters. With that said, even though the castle gives us precautions, you are 

not 

to speak a whisper of the password to 

anyone

, do you hear me? Slytherin does not treat traitors well,” she warned. 

The first years nodded hurriedly. 

“Now, the other forms will be arriving soon.” Just as she said this, the Slytherin door clicked open and in came a flock of second years. “Professor Snape— that’s our head of house— will be coming in to give a speech later on. You are to sit on the floor in front of the fireplace. The prefects will give you a rundown on the internal Slytherin rules after the professor leaves. Understand?”

They nodded again. 

“Good, now move along.” Gemma ushered them onto the floor, leaving some space by the fireplace so that the professor would have some space to stand. Malfoy tried to sit on a couch instead, insisting that he had 

never had to sit on the floor before, his father will hear—

 he didn’t get to finish, because a fifth year glared at him fiercely before pushing him onto the floor. 

“Your prefect told you to sit on the floor,” said the fifth year, voice dangerously low, “Do you not understand how to respect your elders? Did your parents not teach you common courtesy?” 

Malfoy froze in place. 

“Seymour,” Gemma said, sounding half-thankful and half-warning. “He’s a first year, go easy on him. He’ll learn.” 

“He better,” snarled Seymour. 

Soon enough, Slytherins of all heights and ages were filling up the common room. The second years got to sit on cushions on the floor, the third years got to either sit on the chairs or stand at the back, the fourth years got selected couches, and the same went for the fifty, sixth, and seventh years. Harry had a feeling that the selected couches were given according to comfort, with the fourth years getting older, harder couches while the seventh years got the newest, softest couches. 

The prefects didn’t have to do much— anyone under the fifth year who didn’t follow as they were told would go through the privilege of being glared at Caden Seymour. He and Gemma were the two newly-appointed fifth year prefects. Besides them, there were Peregrine Derrick and Arowelle Seymour from sixth year, as well as Terrence Higgs from the seventh. Harry briefly wondered why there was only one prefect from the seventh year. 

Small talk had just begun to break out among the years when there was the soft, unmistakable click of the Slytherin door opening. The room was silenced instantly, and in stepped the intimidating ‘dungeon bat’, as Tracey had so nicely put it. 

Harry felt like the temperature of the room had just dropped by ten degrees. Hermione shivered, as well. Beside them, however, Draco brightened like he had just seen his guardian angel. Since the professor was Draco’s godfather, Harry supposed that part of the ‘guardian angel’ simile was truth. 

“Good evening,” said the professor in a low drawl, his eyes sweeping analytically through the room, hesitating at Harry, crouched on the floor with Hermione. “For those that don’t know, my name is Severus Snape, and you shall call me 

Professor 

Snape while we are at Hogwarts.” 

Harry felt like the last bit was an addition directed towards Draco. 

“For the lower years, I will be your potions professor. For the higher years, it depends whether you passed my exams or not.” Professor Snape glared at a few selected students on the couches. “Regardless of your year, however, I will be your head of house until you graduate. As part of Slytherin, you are expected to bring honour to your house instead of misbehaving and damaging your house’s reputation.” 

The professor cast his cold, stony glare throughout the room once more, and Harry couldn’t help but think that the man was giving pointed looks at certain students. 

“I will 

not 

tolerate any troublemaking while you are under my house. That 

includes 

getting into altercations with other houses,” Professor Snape was glaring at a few fourth, fifth, and sixth years. “It also includes 

pranks

. This kind of childish behaviour will 

not 

be put up with. Don’t think that I won’t give out punishment just because I’m the head of house.” 

The room was so silent that you could hear Harry’s frantic heartbeat. When the professor uttered ‘pranks’, he had looked down and stared right into the depths of Harry’s soul— the boy would be surprised to find that his body hadn’t frozen over yet, for the cold, emotionless glare he had been given seemed capable of just that. 

“With that said,” the professor breathed, dangerously soft and dangerously calm. “I expect Slytherins to stand together as a unit. Outside of these walls,” he gestured smoothly to the common room, “Slytherin is the antagonist of Hogwarts. Outside of these walls, you have 

no one 

but your own housemates. I discourage getting into altercations, but note this— if 

one 

Slytherin gets into a fight, then it is the fight of 

every 

other Slytherin, as well. Inter-house disagreements will be kept 

within 

the common room and those disagreements 

will not 

venture further than the common room door. Slytherins 

will 

defend their own. Am I understood on this matter?” 

“Yes, sir,” chorused the common room. 

Professor Snape was a man who didn’t look capable of a kind 

smile

. He seemed only able of a sneer, or perhaps a victorious smirk. That was why, when the professor smiled softly at his snakes, Harry had to double take to make sure it was the same man. “Good. If there are any minor matters, please refer to your prefects. Terrence is the head prefect of Slytherin house and is highest in authority right below me. Major matters will be communicated to me through your prefects.” 

He took one last glance at the students, all of which were watching him intently. There were a pair of bright, emerald eyes staring at him from the stone-cold floor of the Slytherin dungeon, but the potions professor made an effort to look 

anywhere 

but there. 

Severus Snape offered one last smile to his snakes of the year. “Have a nice night.”

Notes:

I've got a lot to say about this chapter, so let's go— 1. Characters. First off, I hadn't planned on involving so many first year snakes. The original idea was supposed to be a Draco/Hermione/Harry trio, but I did a bunch of research on the Slytherin students and I guess it would be weird if no one else but Draco interacted with Harry, especially with who he is. The 'main' trio of the story will still be those three, but I'm also going to have Harry work on expanding his relationship with the rest of his house. 2. Personality. Obviously, Harry's development is one of my main focuses in rewriting the book. However, as you saw in this chapter, he's not really shy. If anything, he's just a bit introverted, but he doesn't have much problems talking to people his age. The other personality issue is with the rest of the snakes. There's not much information on the other first year snakes, which, no surprise I guess, since they're not the main focus of the canon HP. For Daphne, I'm writing for her to be a very graceful, calm character with a very clear head. Her family isn't that hard on the pureblood/halfblood/mudblood prejudice. Tracey is a bit more blunt and rougher around the edges— her mother is a disgraced pureblood, father's a muggle. She's not very fond of purebloods because of their treatment towards her mother. Blaise is like Daphne in the sense he's very cool-headed and collected. Theodore is much more sarcastic, and he's a little bookworm. I read this really good Theodore/Harry fic and honestly, it's influencing his character in tbwga. I might make him a more active character. Draco, obviously, is much more prejudiced than the rest of them. Pansy is also very prejudiced, like Draco, and doesn't like Hermione much. Thankfully, Hermione has Daphne + Tracey at her side. Hermione is much more loose about following the rules, because Slytherins follow their own set of morals. She follows rules, yes, but those rules are her own. Gemma and Caden(OC) are the common soft-hearted character and the protective, fiercer character. Don't just me, I'm weak for that trope. They're 100% going to end up together. 3. Eggs? I threw in a few fun details and I wanted to share them :P First, the staff that choked on their tea— that's Snape. Secondly, the Slytherin common room password 'Pride and Prejudice' was set by Snape, obviously, and he finds some sort of secret glee in setting a password from a muggle novel for a house full of pureblood supremacists. 4. Future planningOne of the things I'm looking forward to the most is Terrence and Marcus, along with the rest of the Slytherin team. I've more or less worked out the details for the Quidditch-ish arc. There'll be a conflict between Draco + Harry regarding Quidditch (bc Draco's jealous, obv). Lastly, for anyone also writing any Harry Potter fics— I've compiled the list of first year characters, so here you go: 1. Abott, Hannah (H)2. Bones, Susan (H)3. Boot, Terry (R)4. Brocklehurst, Mandy (R)5. Brown, Lavender (G)6. Bulstrode, Millicent (S)7. Crabbe, Vincent (S)8. Cornfoot, Stephen (R)9. Corner, Michael (R)10. Davis, Tracey (S)11. Entwhistle, Kevin (H) 12. Finch-Fletchley, Justin (H)13. Finnigan, Seamus (G)14. Granger, Hermione (S)15. Greengrass, Daphne (S)16. Goldstein, Anthony (R)17. Goyle, Gregory (S)18. Hopkins, Wayne (H)19. Jones, Megan (H)20. Li, Sue (R)21. Longbottom, Neville (G)22. MacDougal, Isobel (R)23. Macmillan, Ernie (H)24. Malfoy, Draco (S)25. Malone, Roger (H)26. Moon, Lily (R)27. Nott, Theodore (S)28. Parkinson, Pansy (S)29. Patil, Padma (R)30. Patil, Parvati (G)31. Perks, Sally-Anne (H)32. Potter, Harry (S)33. Rivers, Oliver (R)34. Roper, Sophie (G)35. Runcorn, -? (H)36. Smith, Sally (G)37. Thomas, Dean (G)38. Turpin, Lisa (R)39. Weasley, Ronald (G)40. Zabini, Blaise (S)You're welcome. This is getting really long, so I'm just going to end with the usual. Let me know what you think! I'm always excited to read comments, esp the long ones :)

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“For the love of 

Merlin

, Draco, stop hogging the bloody toilet!” yelled Theodore, hair a tousled mess as he banged on the door. The boy grumbled grumpily, slumping against the outside of the shared bathroom belonging to the first year Slytherin boys. 

Harry stifled a light laugh, glad that he had gotten up extra early. Excitement rushed into him like water from a broken dam when he woke up, seeing dark green curtains all around him. The Slytherin’s dorm was a circular shape, sectioned by elongated panes of glass that bordered the line between the dungeons and the lake, decorated by elegant emerald and sleek silver. 

The previous night, when the boys were all preparing to go to bed, Harry noticed that he felt oddly exposed in his four-poster bed. The enclosure of his cupboard had become a sort of comfort over the years— he could see all four corners of his quarters, could see any dangers that lay in wait— but now that he was in the open, wide area of the Slytherin dorms, a sense of unease filled him. Thankfully, Blaise noticed his discomfort and helped him pull the curtains that Harry was too short to reach. 

“Good morning!” 

Up in the common room, Harry couldn’t help but smile when he was tackled by a beaming Hermione. Her hair had been calmed from its wildness and sat looking smoother and shinier— if the victorious smile on Daphne’s lips was anything to go by, the silvery-blonde girl had played a hand in the matter. 

“Your hair looks great, Hermione,” he complimented. 

The muggleborn flushed with happiness, brightening significantly. 

“Draco, if you don’t come out in a minute, we’re leaving without—” Theodore, who was eventually allowed into the bathroom after Draco completed his thirty-step skin-care routine, called out in a threat. All the other boys had gotten dressed in under five minutes, but the Malfoy heir was insistent on looking flawless on his first day. Harry was confident that Draco had been adjusting the angle of his tie for the past half an hour. 

With a strong scowl, Draco slammed the door of the dorm open, hair slicked back and tie straighter than Harry thought possible. 

“I thought you’d died in there,” commented Theodore sarcastically. 

“Shut up.”

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“That’s him— the shortest Slytherin kid.” 

“The one with the glasses?”

“Did you see his face? His 

scar

?” 

Whispers followed Harry everywhere— ever since they emerged from the underground tunnels of the Slytherin quarters, students followed him everywhere. Harry wasn’t blind. He might be a bit short-sighted, but he could see well enough to see the gawking eyes, the students that doubled back and walked past again to get a second, overly-curious look at him. It was awful, being treated like a zoo animal. He wished that everyone would just leave him alone. 

The castle was overwhelmingly big, and if Harry was honest, without Draco— whose father had brought him to Hogwarts multiple times before on business— he would be completely and utterly lost. The blonde proudly led them through the corridors, never once faltering in his steps. Soon enough, the little troop had arrived at the Great Hall for breakfast. 

“Just ignore them,” offered Theo helpfully. There was something inside the soft hazel of Theodore’s eyes that told Harry the taller of the two had been through the same thing before. “It’ll eventually become background noise.” 

Not long after the boys settled, Daphne, Hermione and Tracey entered the Great Hall and found their places at the Slytherin table. Class schedules had already been given out the previous night by the prefects— they had double period Charms with the Ravenclaws first thing Monday, Herbology down at the greenhouses three times a week, History of Magic on Tuesday, Astronomy every Wednesday with the Hufflepuffs at midnight, Defense Against Dark Arts on Thursday and double potions with Gryffindors on Friday. 

Hermione, who was as eager as can be to get to Charms, ate as quickly as she could, urging Harry to do the same between her swallows. Not one to be out-done, Draco hurried his breakfast, albeit in a more graceful and refined manner than the other two. 

There was no helping the smile on Harry’s face, even as he was dragged to Charms with Hermione’s vice-like grip around his wrist and a sulking Draco behind them. The rest of the Slytherins remained at breakfast, enjoying the foods served by the house elves— enjoying it on Draco’s behalf, they said. Meanwhile, the trio of snakes were winding up the corridors and weaving in between passages. 

On their way, however, they stumbled across Argus Filch, the caretaker, and his dusty, lamp-eyed cat. Draco scrunched up his nose in distaste at the sight of the man and grumbled: “Squib,” under his breath. This didn’t go unnoticed by the other three. 

“That isn’t a nice thing to say, is it?” Harry furrowed his brows. He hadn’t an idea what ‘Squib’ meant, but judging by the blonde’s tone (and his character), the word was more an insult than anything else. 

“It’s true,” shrugged Draco with a sneer. 

“It’s not nice.” Harry frowned, turning back to the caretaker. “Mr. Filch, I apologise.” 

The man with the crooked back looked stunned at the turn of events. Whatever he had been expecting, it hadn’t been an apology. Initially, he looked ready to fly into a rage— but Harry’s words had stopped him in the middle of his tracks, taking the situation down an unforeseeable turn. 

“I’m not exactly sure what a squib means,” said Harry slowly, “but if it’s offensive, I apologise on behalf of Draco.” 

Mr. Filch opened his mouth and closed it again like a goldfish out of depth. Mrs. Norris had taken advantage of everyone’s distraction to weave herself around Harry’s legs, taking a liking to the kind, firm voice of the dark-haired boy. A request to pet the feline was voiced, and Hermione begrudgingly admitted that they could spare some time to stroke the dusty, lamp-eyed cat and still make it to class on time. And so Harry and Hermione fussed over Mrs. Norris, who greatly enjoyed the attention. Meanwhile, Draco stood behind them, fuming silently with crossed arms. 

Charms was taught by a short wizard by the name of Professor Filtwick, who had to stand on a stack of thick textbooks to be able to see above his teaching desk. He started class by taking attendance, and when he came across Harry’s name, he squeaked so loudly that he toppled over, sending a resulting landslide of the books he was standing on. 

Their first Charms class went over the basics of spellcasting. Harry listened attentively, fumbling messily with his quill as he tried to take notes. There were splatters of ink across his parchment that made bits of it indiscernible, but Hermione had taken notes too, and offered to let him cross-reference hers to pick out the bits he’d missed. 

Herbology was taught by a warm witch dressed in lovely yellow hues— the Head of Hufflepuff, Harry heard. They were to trek down to the greenhouses themselves, and there they would learn how to take care of magical plants, how to harvest their fruits and stems and sap, and how the plants could be useful. Theodore had introduced him to the occupation of 

Healer

— the doctor equivalent of the magical world— and Harry was determined to do well in Herbology in order to pursue a career in healing. Once he told Hermione this, they set a date for a library session to help pick out books that would be beneficial to Harry’s dream. 

History of Magic was, as much as Harry didn’t want to admit it, the most boring class of all. It was taught by a ghost— Professor Binns— who had, according to Draco, fallen asleep a long, long time ago in the staffroom. The professor had died in his sleep, but once he woke, he simply gathered his belongings and went on to teach his next class. 

Professor Binns would read the text out of the textbook and lecture them that way. Harry couldn’t help but find the class uninteresting. There was no physical interaction with the class, like in Charms and Herbology, and there were no notes to take, since the professor wasn’t giving them any extra information. It was very tiring to sit through, and he couldn’t help but feel relieved when they were finally dismissed. 

Transfiguration was taught by the deputy headmistress, Professor McGonagall. Like Harry predicted, she was not one to cross. She was strict and clever, giving them a talking-down in their very first class. 

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.” 

She then transformed her desk into a pig and back, flicking her wand quickly to prevent the books and ink bottle on the table from falling. They all got excited, of course— but very quickly that excitement faded, as everyone realised that they weren’t going to be changing tables into farm animals anytime soon. The professor began to run them through the basic laws of transfiguration. Harry was very delighted to find that the principle of conservation of energy existed in the magical world— in the form of the transfiguration laws, which stated that transfigured objects maintained the value of the original objects. 

After an initial lecture, Professor McGonagall handed out matches and set them to changing those into needles. Harry, who was seated next to Hermione (much to Draco’s annoyance), took a moment to recall what the transfiguration teacher had told them. 

“Magic is 10% technique, 30% skill and 60% will.” He muttered under his breath, drawing his wand from his book bag. Beside him, Hermione was doing a quick read-through of her notes before getting onto the task at hand. 

Soon the classroom was filled with students jabbing at their matches while yelling incantations. Sounds of frustration burst out all through. Harry couldn’t help but feel a little glad— he had been worried about being left behind, since many of the Slytherins came from magical families. Luckily for him, they weren’t much more experienced than he was, either. 

“Yes!” Hermione cheered at his left, pumping her fist into the air. Her match had become silver and quite sharp at the end. The girl’s cheeks were flushed red with concentration as she turned to him. “Harry, you’ve got to visualise it in your head.” 

The boy supposed that it made sense. He pressed the image of a needle into his mind— a needle, just like one that he borrowed from Aunt Petunia’s sewing kit to repair any hand-me-downs from Dudley. Squeezing his eyes shut, he imprinted the visualisation into his eyes, gripped his wand, and— 

“You did it!” clapped Hermione happily, just as Professor McGonagall came around to do a swoop around the class. 

“Not bad, Mr. Potter, Ms. Granger.” said the professor, picking up their needles. As Harry took a closer look, he realised that his match had gone all silver and pointy, as well. It also had a large slit at its end, for threading in string for mending. A burst of pride exploded inside Harry when the professor showed their classmates the work of the two. “Well done,” she said, returning their needles and offering them a rare smile. 

Hearing this, Draco fumed and nearly broke his match into half. 

Defense against dark arts was a bit of a let down. The Slytherins sniggered as Professor Quirrell stuttered his way through the lesson. Harry couldn’t help but feel bad for the professor when Pansy Parkinson questioned the professor’s credibility, making the man turn pink at his ears and neck. Sure, the classroom smelled like a garlic warehouse, but there was no reason that Professor Quirrell deserved such horrible treatment from his students. 

Friday morning came, and Harry strolled into the Great Hall with Hermione and Theodore, feeling more excited than he had been for the other classes. Hermione was a bit repelled at their upcoming Potions class— ”

Why would anyone add the internal organs of a snail to a potion that you’d end up drinking

?”— but Harry was never squeamish, even from a young age. 

He had been pouring over his Potions textbook, and two days ago, he found a fourth year Potions textbook. He asked around to see if it was anyone’s, but when no one claimed it, he happily took it in as his own and started reading through. While Hermione was a little disgusted by 

physical 

potions making, she had nothing against 

reading 

about it. The two snakes had squished together in a quiet corner of the common room, pouring over page and page of it. Theodore joined them too, uninterested in Blaise and Daphne’s chess match. 

Draco had, at the very end, very reluctantly joined them, too. He looked constipated as he sat down next to Hermione. 

With anticipation and intrigue buzzing on the end of his every nerve, Harry descended back into the dungeons, Hermione at his tail. They’d passed Mrs. Norris on their way down, and had stopped to give her a quick pet. On request, Mr. Filch had allowed the two snakes to carry around cat treats for the feline who hard-workingly patrolled the corridors every night. Now, upon sight or scent of the two Slytherins, Mrs. Norris would come bounding over, meowing and demanding for the treats she knew the two carried in their pockets. 

Potions was being taught in one of the dungeons. It was cold down there, with no natural light as it was below ground level, but Harry had come to find himself accustomed to the temperature. He supposed that it was his magic keeping him warm, just like how it had done on the night Hagrid banged down the door of the little shack on the rock. It also explained how his thin flannel had dried much, much quicker than Aunt Petunia and Dudley’s clothes. 

Harry had a feeling that Friday was going to be a very nice day— first, they had potions, which he was looking forward to the most— 

and 

during breakfast, Hedwig had swooped in with a letter from Hagrid, inviting them for tea! He had asked Hermione instantly, of course, and since Draco was nearby, he’d asked the blonde, too, not wanting him to feel left out. The blonde had sneered about the giant setting his house on fire, but since he didn’t say no, Harry assumed he was coming along anyway. 

Having arrived at the potions classroom early, even with the Mrs. Norris delay, Harry retrieved his potions textbook, sitting by the side of the corridor with Hermione. They shared his book, going through the basic potions and discussing which one they were looking forward to brewing the most. 

The two jumped and squeaked in shock when the potions professor slinked up to them, completely silent with the exception of the 

swish-swish 

sound of his robes. Professor Snape eyed them— two Slytherins, snuggled against each other by the door of the potions classroom, sharing a textbook and chattering excitedly. Wordlessly, he gestured for them to get off the floor and into the class. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Getting so close to a girl already, Mr. Potter?” The potions professor couldn’t help himself, making a snarky remark as the James-Potter-lookalike settled onto a front-row work table. A small part of the man’s heart squeezed painfully when the boy flinched and drew back with a hurt expression. “It’s only the first week.” 

Just as quickly as he made the remark, Severus started wishing he could take it back. The flash of hurt that phased through the first year Slytherin’s emerald green eyes looked exactly like the flash of betrayal in his former best friend’s eyes the moment he uttered the word ‘

Mudblood

’. Instead of rising to the bait like the older Potter would’ve, the young boy kept his mouth shut and flicked his gaze away. Beside him, Granger looked uncomfortable. 

The potions professor turned his attention away from the two kids, heading into the sectioned ingredients storage room at the side, busying himself with preparing the ingredients for their first potion. It was as if he had prepared a chart predicting James Potter’s son, and made preparations for a counterattack. However, he had forgotten an important, 

crucial

 factor— Harry Potter might be James Potter’s son, but he was just as much Lily Evan’s child. 

The boy’s personality was derailing completely off of what Severus had prepared for. 

There had been no hate and loathing in Harry’s eyes at Severus’s remark— no hate, just hurt. Severus had heard… Things from the other professors. Fillius said that the boy was attentive and quiet, and the most noise he made was when he fumbled and struggled with his quill. Pomona said that the boy was a dear and possesed natural talent for herbology— he had even stayed back behind class to ask the Head of Hufflepuff for advice on his next steps should he want to be a healer. Minerva, who wasn’t one for singing exaggerated praises, had come bursting into the staffroom after her Slytherin class, whispering: ‘He has his father’s talent for Transfiguration,’. 

He thought his colleagues were singing praises for the child because he reminded them 

so

, 

so 

much of the beloved James Potter. But no, no— he was wrong. 

His colleagues were singing praises for the child because 

yes

, Harry Potter might be a carbon-copy of his father, but personality and behavioural wise, Harry Potter was a copy of his 

mother

.  


Be calm

, Severus chided himself, trying to refocus and straighten his composure before he went back into the class to face the first year Gryffindors and Slytherins. 

He is a child. You are an adult. Don’t judge him on his father. Above everything, he is one of your snakes and not one of the lions

. 

He swooped back into the class like the dungeon-bat that he was (un)affectionately termed as by Hogwarts’ students. Sweeping a cool gaze through the room, he began to take the attendance, quietly calling out names. When he reached Harry’s, however, he skipped it, ticking him present without making the boy announce his presence. 

The Gryffindors weren’t observant enough to notice, but his Slytherins, unfortunately, were. Across the room, he noticed Theodore’s curiously cocked eyebrow, the slight furrow of Blaise, and Granger’s frown. 

Fortunately

, none of the snakes were dumb enough to voice their observation. 

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses… I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death— if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” 

The class watched him quietly. In the second row, Draco was perked up with attention, desperate to start showing everyone just how good he was. Severus would expect nothing short of good from the boy— as Draco’s godfather, he had been on-and-off tutoring the blonde boy in the arts of potion-making since a young age. 

In front of Draco, however, there were two snakes with the exact opposite reaction. Hermione Granger, the new muggleborn in his house, was said to be an outstanding student by the other teachers, with a slight urge to please all her professors. She wasn’t showing any of that behaviour in 

his

 class, however. The muggleborn was leaned back into her seat, lacking any of the eagerness his colleagues talked about. She wasn’t even 

looking 

at him, instead staring at her table like she’d never seen one before. 

Beside her, James Potter’s son was staring at the corner of his closed textbook. 

“Potter,” he said quietly. The boy flinched, and reluctantly Harry looked up to meet his dark gaze. Within the emerald orbs resided a tinge of hesitance. Severus recognised the creature dwelling inside the dark-haired Slytherin— a sea monster by the name of 

fight 

or 

flight

. Judging by the tenseness in the boy’s shoulders, Severus would guess that the odds were in the favour of 

flight

. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

“The draught of living death,” answered Harry quietly, pausing. “Sir.” 

Severus tried not to look surprised. The draught of living death was near the very end of the first year syllabus— did that mean that Harry had actually finished reading his textbook, cover to cover? Instead of praising the boy, like he normally did for his snakes, he only nodded ever-so-slightly in approval. “Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” 

Behind Harry, Draco fidgeted, clearly having withdrawal symptoms from lack of attention. 

“From the stomach of a goat, sir,” said Harry, flicking his gaze away. The emerald eyes that Severus was accustomed to seeing in his dreams were now concentrated on the corner of a storage cupboard. 

“And what is it used for?” Severus challenged, pushing on. He wanted to see how far the boy could go. If Harry could answer, then the potions professor would push past the first year syllabus, just to see if—

“It can cure most poisons,” replied Harry, voice quieter than ever. Severus doubted that the Gryffindors at the back of the class could hear the boy. “Sir.” 

Severus was definitely past the first year syllabus now. His mind whirled to the last class he had— the fourth year Ravens and Puffs. “What is the difference between monkshood, wolfsbane and aconite?”

The boy paused, flicking his eyes to meet the professor for a moment before he answered. “... They are the same plant, sir,” He answered, hesitating, as if he wasn't completely sure. 

Impressed, Severus nodded. How in Merlin’s name Potter knew something from the fourth year syllabus was beyond him. “10 points to Slytherin. Do try to sound more sure of yourself next time, Mr. Potter.” 

A few snickers erupted from the Gryffindor side of the room, silenced by a singular glare from the potions professor. “I doubt any of you could’ve answered the questions Mr. Potter just did. Why aren’t you taking notes? Weasley! What is the draught of living death?” 

The redhead boy looked like a deer caught in headlights. He glanced at his housemates, all of which gave him the ‘

I can’t help you

’ look. Nervously, Weasley looked up and met the professor’s gaze. “I, er, I don’t know.” 

“Granger?”

“It’s a sleeping potion, sir.” answered the muggleborn, clearer and louder than Harry was, but with the same hint of hesitance in her voice. Two of his snakes were shying away from him already, and all he had done was say 

one 

thing. 

Severus nodded, whipping out his wand to begin writing the procedure for the potion they were going to be working on. It was a simple cure for boils, something he always started with in the first year syllabus. The procedure was his own, with modifications that he experimented and tested with throughout the years. If the kids were smart, they would realise the procedures he was giving varied from the textbook, and they would copy the steps down. 

He set the students to work, with their deskmate as their partner. The students got to work instantly, with the exception of Potter and Granger in the front-row. The two were staring at the procedure on the board. 

“It’s different.” voiced the muggleborn softly. Severus nodded in approval. The two were sharp for kids their age— and for them to be able to identify the differences without a glance at the textbook… It simply meant that they knew the textbook’s procedures well enough. 

Potter stared at the board for a moment longer before shrugging. “Can you get the dry ingredients? The nettles and the porcupine quills— I’ll go get the slugs and the squirrel tendons.” 

“I’m starting to think you know me too well.” The muggleborn shot him a thankful smile.

The potions professor tore his gaze away from the two— he had a feeling that Granger and Potter were, very quickly, going to become two of the most brilliant potions students he’d ever taught, although from Harry’s words, Granger might be squeamish. That was definitely a hurdle she needed to overcome if she wanted to succeed in his class. 

He turned his gaze to Draco, who was probably going to have a breakdown if he didn’t receive some attention. Complimenting the blond’s work, he moved on from Lucius’s son and onto the rest of his Slytherins, picking out which ones would be likely to proceed into NEWTS potions in the future. Greengrass’s skills were quite polished, although her partner, Davis’s was mediocre. Nott was on-par with Greengrass in cutting technique, and he had a firm, steady hand when weighing his ingredients. Zabini was doing slightly above average. Parkinson was… Slightly below average, and her partner, Millicent, was absolutely terrible at handling ingredients. 

“You’re going to bruise your ingredients if you keep handling them like that,” he hissed, already spotting the bruises forming on the poor, abused horned slug. 

The Gryffindors were another nightmare in their own right. 

After a round of criticism at the lions, Severus turned back to his own house to survey their work. In the front row, Potter and Granger were working in unison: Potter was slowly stirring the potion clockwise with a steady hand while Granger had put out the fire and was carefully adding porcupine quills, one at a time. Under their eyes, the potion changed colours, eventually becoming a near-perfect hue. 

The potions professor couldn’t help but feel proud. He watched them for a moment longer, making sure that they were still on the right track— their potion was near perfect, and it would be a waste if one of them slipped up and made a mistake. Granger passed a vial to her partner, who swiftly collected a sample of their potion and plugged it with a stopper. An accomplished smile was shared between the two as a result of their hard work. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

There was no helping the victorious smile on Harry’s face as he returned to his worktable. His and Hermione’s finished potion sat on the professor’s desk, in the full glory of its near-perfect state. The textbook had provided a comparison chart of the colour they should’ve achieved, and Hermione had very proudly announced to him that they were on the tier right below perfect. 

Just as he was returning to his desk, he spotted a brewing disaster at the corner of his eye. Blood catalysed by panic, Harry hurried to catch Neville’s hand before the round-faced boy dumped the remaining of his porcupine quills into the still-boiling cauldron. Seamus looked startled at his intervention, still unaware of the fatal mistake the Gryffindor pair had made: They neglected to put out the fire before adding the quills. 

Luckily, the potion didn’t immediately explode, as that was on the top of Harry’s worse-case-scenario list. Unluckily, it started bubbling over; the cauldron started trembling and shaking violently, splashing its contents on anyone close enough. 

Fortunately, Harry, who had his fair share of experience with sizzling, white-hot oil, had the sense to duck. Neville, on the other hand, had no such sense, and stood there in shock as he got drenched by his awry potion. 

“Harry!” exclaimed Hermione somewhere behind him. 

“Idiot boy!” snarled Professor Snape, stomping towards them. Harry felt his blood run cold, colder than the rain that splashed onto his face on the boat trip to the shack. The man’s face was thunderous as he waved his wand to clean up the mess. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” 

Neville whimpered, shaking in terror and pain as angry red boils started forming around his face. It was a horrendous sight, and swiftly enough, the boy’s face was entirely swollen with red and yellow pus. All around, the other students shrunk into their seats, afraid that the boils were infectious and transmissible. 

“You!” jabbed the professor at Seamus, who jumped at the sudden attention. “Take them to the hospital wing!” 

The other Gryffindor boy stepped carefully towards Neville, watching the floor for any stray blotches of the potion. Slinging Neville’s arm around his shoulder, Seamus started to lead the round-faced boy out of the room before glancing back at Harry expectantly. Harry stood rooted at where he was, feeling confused. He turned to see Hermione doing the same. The Slytherin muggleborn gave him a questioning look, as if saying ‘What are you doing?’. 

“Mr. Potter,” said Professor Snape behind him, “What are you waiting for?” 

Like a deer in headlights, Harry stared, completely caught off guard by the professor’s question. He was just about to return his seat when the tall, pale man stopped him in his tracks. Unsure of why the situation was escalating this way, Harry didn’t say anything. 

“Harry,” Hermione said slowly, like she had just realised something. “Does… Does your face hurt?” 

“... No?” Furrowing his brows, Harry glanced from the professor to his friend, still unable to comprehend the situation. He didn’t have the slightest clue as to why his classmates were all staring at him in varying stages of concern and horror. 

The muggleborn looked even more concerned now. “... Harry,” Hermione said, “You’re injured. You… You know that, right?” 

“I’m—” 
“Harry,” Hermione sounded pained. “There are rather severe burns on your face. Can you really feel no pain at all?” 
“Ms. Granger,” said Professor Snape softly, cutting into half the silence that reigned over the classroom. “Why don’t you escort Mr. Potter to the infirmary as well?” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Sweet Merlin!” gasped Madam Pomfrey, the mediwitch who lived full-time at Hogwarts. She had been working on her paperwork peacefully at the corner of the hospital wing when Seamus kicked the door open, alarming the woman so much that she came dashing over as if there had been a fire. “What happened here?” 

“Dungeons— porcupines— fire— suddenly—” said Seamus, gesturing around wildly with his free hand. Next to him, Neville was openly sobbing, the boils pulsing angrily against the tightness of his skin.  

“We were in potions,” cut in Hermione calmly, a comforting hand around Harry’s wrist. The boy hadn’t looked in anyone’s eyes ever since they came up from the dungeons, choosing to stare at his feet with a blank face instead. “Professor Snape had us brew the basic cure for boils, and Neville added his porcupine quills before turning off the fire. Harry went to stop him before he could add 

all 

of the quills. The potion bubbled over— most of it hit Neville, but Harry got burned, too.” 

The mediwitch glanced between the two boys in question. “Alright,” she nodded, understanding the events much more precisely thanks to Hermione’s informative, calm explanation. “Have them sit down over there, I’ll go get some balms.” 

Madam Pomfrey disappeared for a while into a storage room, returning with some yellow substance, jarred properly in labelled glasses. With a soothing voice, she brought Neville down from his hysterics, eyes flicking every once a while to Harry, who still hadn’t made a sound ever since he’d been brought in. 

Muttering a few spells, the Hogwarts’ healer instantly quelled a decent amount of Neville’s pain, resulting in the boy calming significantly. She gently dabbed the ointment at his cheeks and hands. Within a few minutes, the boils shrunk and Neville’s face returned to its natural hue. 

“Alright, that’s you done,” said Madam Pomfrey, handing Neville a jar with Pain-Reliever written on a label with spidery handwriting. “Use this to dab at any reddish or itchy areas. Keep applying it until the end of the week. If you’re feeling alright, you can return to class.” 

Neville looked white at the idea of returning to Professor Snape’s class, but did so anyway. With one last look at a still-silent Harry, the two Gryffindors begin their trek back down to the dungeons, bidding the warmth of the hospital wing goodbye. 

“Now let’s take a look at you,” said Madam Pomfrey softly, moving on to the dark-haired boy who hadn’t stopped staring at his feet. At first she thought it was shock that induced his quietness— now that she took a closer look at him, however, the truth might be deeper than what was present on the surface. “Harry, right?” 

The boy nodded stiffly. 

“I’m going to need to wipe your burns with a cold cloth first, okay? It might hurt just a little bit,” she told him in a motherly tone. 

There was one initial flinch when the damp cloth made contact with Harry’s skin, but other than that, the boy was completely still— so still, in fact, that it looked as if he had been stupefied. Working meticulously, the mediwitch eased the remaining flecks of the potion from the boy’s skin, proceeding to use magic to reverse the rest of the damage. Then, she had him pull down the collar of his robes just to check if there were any unseen burns. 

“Does it hurt?” asked the mediwitch kindly. 

Staring at her blankly for a moment, Harry shook his head. At his side, Hermione looked even more concerned than ever. 

“If you feel any pain or throbbing, don’t hesitate to come to me or Professor Snape, alright? He’s your Head of House, and above being a potions master, he’s also a qualified healer,” Madam Pomfrey told him softly. “You may return to your class.” 

With a nudge from Hermione, Harry finally seemed to snap back into life, panic filling his eyes as he was ambushed by unfamiliar surroundings. Once he regained his composure, the green-eyed boy bowed his thanks and followed the worried muggleborn back to class, still looking every bit like a terrified baby deer. 

Madam Pomfrey watched them go with a singular thought in her head— someone needed to sit Severus Snape down and give him a very, very serious talk.

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────“Alright, that’s enough studying.” declared Hermione, two hours into their library session. A plethora of reference books lay in front of her, some hanging off the edge of the too-small-table. The muggleborn had collected the books for their Transfiguration essay, even though some of the books exceeded the first year syllabus. “Slacking off, are we, Granger?” sneered Draco. The blonde had been in the common room when Hermione dragged a still-blank Harry out the snake door, lecturing the smaller boy about preparing early for exams. Determined to not let Hermione ‘hog’ Harry, the pureblood invited himself to the session and tagged along. “I thought better of y—”“Studying  isn’t  my whole personality,  Malfoy,” she hissed, brown eyes ablaze with cold fury. Before Draco could retort, Harry intercepted tiredly: “We’re going to get kicked out by Madam Pince if either of you say a word more.” The two instantly closed their mouths. Neither were blind, unobservant idiots— Harry had clearly been down in the dumps since Potions, and nothing had been able to cheer him up. His entire demeanor was dim, his once-bright eyes dull. “Harry,” said Hermione, “didn’t Hagrid invite you over to his hut this morning?” Draco snorted, but had enough sense not to make any cutting remarks. And so the three set off, Draco following reluctantly. He loudly assured them that he was only there to make sure the giant didn’t accidentally kill them by resorting to his ‘uncivilised ways’. This elicited a sharp look from Harry— the most emotion he had shown since that morning. Hermione was too relieved by the boy’s display to throw in her admonishment at Draco. Hagrid lived in a large wooden house by the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and this time around, Draco was smart enough to keep his thoughts to himself. The three Slytherins neared the residence, looking around at the interesting possessions the giant kept outside his house. When Harry knocked, there was a large commotion from inside— something that sounded like the clattering of a row of metal pots and pans, frantic scrambling of a very large animal, and Hagrid’s shouts of: “Back, Fang,  back!” Harry’s face lit up a bit when Hagrid’s great face appeared in the small slit of the doorway. “Heya, Harry! Oh— hang on—  back, Fang—” They were let in, and much to Hermione’s shock and Draco’s horror, Hagrid was struggling to hold onto the collar of a large black boarhound. It was as if someone scaled up the dog to the giant’s size. The three Slytherins instantly reached the same thought, simultaneously— if even  Hagrid had trouble pulling the dog back, then they were done for if the canine ever decided to attack them. There was only one room inside. Ham and other miscellaneous meats hung from a grill on the ceiling, dangling in their red glory. A copper kettle was warming up over the fireplace, and in the corner there was a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. A dog’s bed— large enough for a wolf— was beside the fire, filled with a torn baby blue blanket and chew toys the size of Harry’s entire arm. “Make yerself at home!” said Hagrid cheerfully. He let go of Fang’s collar, much to Draco’s absolute horror. The blonde boy scrambled desperately onto the couch. Attracted by the movement, Fang dashed after the pureblood— making Draco screech all the more. “Here, boy,” said Harry quietly, whistling softly under his breath. The hound’s ears perked up and he redirected to bound for Harry instead, making a laugh burst from the boy’s mouth when he tacked Harry and started licking his ears excitedly. “I’m starting to think that Harry has some sort of power over animals,” muttered Hermione as she carefully navigated the room, moving slowly to reach the same couch Draco was taking refuge on. “I’m going to agree with you for once,” said Draco, looking terrified. “Shh…” hushed Harry. Fang fell to all fours at once, peering his big, round eyes at the boy, who had to be one-eighth of the dog’s weight. “Good boy, Fang.” Offering a kind smile to the hound, Harry made his way over to the couch, and the dog trotted after him, wagging his tail as it settled by Harry’s feet. Draco looked paler than a ghost. “Thanks for having us, Hagrid. I hope it’s okay that I brought Hermione and Draco with me,” said Harry softly, one hand scratching Fang’s big head. The giant assured him that it was okay, although he did falter when his beetle-like eyes stopped at Draco. Uncomfortable, the blonde shifted on the couch, more than aware about his father’s past actions. Still, even if the giant had a bad experience with the older Malfoy, Hagrid didn’t mention it. Instead, he merrily offered tea and rock cakes to Draco, just like he did to Harry and Hermione. As Hermione was happily telling Hagrid all about the lessons they’d had and the assignments they’d been given, Harry noticed a newspaper— the  Daily Prophet  — on the coffee table, slightly stained with an unknown substance. It wasn’t the stain that attracted his attention, however— it was the  title . ‘Gringotts Break-In Latest’ Feeling his interest perk, Harry reached for the newspaper, scanning over the article swiftly, listening to Hermione’s excited chatter with half a mind’s worth of attention. 
 Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.  

 “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokes-goblin this afternoon.  
Furrowing his eyebrows, Harry concluded that it had to be vault seven hundred and thirteen— the one he and Hagrid stopped at after they dropped by his vault. The contents of the vault, that small grubby package— Harry figured that it must be something of great value, for someone to attempt robbery for it. It was barely two inches large, but the value of it was high— high enough for someone to risk  death . Harry took one more glance at the article, and decided— Whatever the package was, It was none of his business. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Severus was having a good day. The keyword being  ‘was  ’. As in, before his first year Slytherin-Gryffindor joint class, before the accident with Longbottom’s potion, before the completely anomalous reaction that Potter had given him. Just as he was thinking that things couldn’t possibly get worse— they  did . Being yelled at by the Hogwarts mediwitch hadn’t exactly been on his itinerary of the day, but there he was, grimacing meekly in his  very own office, no less. Those who thought that the scariest woman in the castle was Minerva McGonagall clearly had never met Poppy Pomfrey when she was angry. Severus felt like a little schoolboy again, being lectured as the mediwitch dabbed bruise paste on the newest records of his latest scuffle. The woman paced back and forth in front of Severus’s desk, giving him a bit of a headache. She waved her hands around animatedly, talking about the boy’s unresponsiveness, the lack of flinching when she applied the balm  directly on the wound, how he felt completely out-of-touch. “Severus, don’t you think that it’s a possibility—?”“No,” he replied coldly, refusing to entertain the thought. Poppy gave him a scathing look. “Don’t you use that tone on me, Severus,” she warned, eyes flaring. That was the face of a woman who had seen Severus at his worst— a scrawny, bony schoolboy who was smaller than the other kids his age, who was completely helpless when they ganged up on him, who was filled with a sense of despair instead of joy. “I  refuse to believe that—” he began, only to be cut off just as quickly. “You promised me that you wouldn’t be biased.” Poppy hissed. A sudden bout of offense rose within Severus, catalysing a sharp, defensive tone in his words. “I am  not being biased. I just think that there’s no way—” “You  are being biased!” accused Poppy fiercely, “If you weren’t, you’d stop for a moment and consider that perhaps—” “There’s no way—” “Try to look further than two feet in front of you—” “I  refuse to believe—” “This isn’t about  believing—” “I  REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT HARRY BLOODY POTTER WAS ABUSED!” roared Severus, flames of anger licking hungrily at the guilt in his heart. Poppy was too stunned to say a word.  The man was shaking as he spoke. “There is  no  way Albus would’ve left him there if— Albus’s golden boy would deserve nothing short of a family that  coddled  and  spoilt  and practically  worshipped  him like the  prince everyone thinks that he—” “Severus!” snapped the mediwitch, completely unintimidated by the potions master’s outburst. Any other staff or student would shirk away the moment they witnessed Severus Snape losing his cool, but Poppy Pomfrey had seen all the things the man wanted to hide. “Harry is  one of your Slytherins  . I think you and I can both conclude, after today’s events, that Harry is absolutely  nothing  like his father— the sooner you can accept that, the better it is, both for  you  and  him .” The office was completely silent for a moment, save for the lingering echoes of Severus’s outburst. Poppy’s expression softened. “Severus,” she said kindly, approaching him with a gentle hand, as one would do so when approaching a frightened, trapped animal. “Harry is not his father.” She, of all people, knew the full extent of all the damage Severus had endured through his years at Hogwarts— especially the damage done in by the hands of James Potter, both emotionally and physically. In his later years, Severus stopped going to her for his wounds. He had simply learned to brew his own medicines and balms, retreating from the hospital wing in shame of being spotted there. “There… There is no way Potter… No way his relatives…” The Potions Master’s head was dipped, in fear that the witch would see right through him if she caught a glance at the flakes of pain in his eyes. “... Severus?” said Poppy cautiously. “There’s no way,” said the man, desperately mumbling the phrase over and over again. “There’s no way that— that Harry Potter— the bloody boy-who-lived— James Potter’s son— there’s— there’s no way he was—” “Severus,” said Poppy, trying to placate the man. Throughout all her years working at Hogwarts, she had  never seen Severus Snape on the verge of a breakdown, and it all felt very intimidating. The man always gave the impression that he had his entire life under control, that he had all his affairs sorted, all his emotions neatly categorised. From the beginning of his teaching career within the castle, Severus had always maintained the cool, emotionless, unfazed image that he wanted to portray to the students.And yet, right before the mediwitch’s eyes, a fissure was breaking the potions master’s stone-cold mask into a million pieces. “There… There’s no way!” yelled Severus, eyes ablaze with a wild desperation for someone—  anyone — to tell him that he was right. “Harry James Potter— cannot— have been—” “Severus…” Poppy tried again. “No!” hissed the potions master, glaring at his colleague as if she had just told him she was fully responsible for global warming. “I won’t—” “It doesn’t matter what you will or won’t believe!” Poppy snapped, making the younger of the two flinch under her gaze. “We probably won’t know for sure unless the boy gives us a verbal confirmation— but there’s no doubting what the  evidence tells us, Severus.” For the second time in his entire lifetime, Severus Snape looked  broken . “If… If he really was abused…” Feeling that the Slytherin just needed to voice his thoughts, the healer stayed silent. It wasn’t often that the man allowed his emotions to leak, so when the floodgates were finally opened— there were years and years’ worth of dammed water rushing out into freedom. “That… That would mean that I… I’ve failed Lily,” murmured Severus, his voice cracking. “I… I  promised  that I would watch over her son, if ever anything happened to them… I thought he… I thought he was safe, and  loved —” The mediwitch hushed him soothingly, reaching out to pat his shoulders reassuringly. For a moment, she had a vision of a small, twelve-year-old Severus, hiccuping and trying his very best to hold back the tears pouring onto his cheeks. Horace Slughorn was never the most empathetic of people, and he most definitely was not capable of consoling a boy with a broken home. The young Slytherin had turned to the mediwitch, finding a comfort in her low, soothing voice— one that sounded so, so alike to his mother’s. Once, Severus had confided to the mediwitch that his mother used to hold him tight, caressing the back of his head while Tobias Snape (Poppy swore to curse the living hell out of the man if she ever crossed paths with him) went on into a drunken rage. As he grew older, however, Severus distanced himself from her, refraining from submitting to her motherly tone in fear of the mockery his yearmates constantly slandered him with. “There was no way you could’ve known, Severus,” she said, reasoning it out with him. Logic was always one of her strong traits, and she found it very effective in calming people like the potions master. “It isn’t too late, you know. Harry is under  your  care now—” “Out!” said the potions master abruptly, voice trembling shakily. “Out. Now.” The woman complied, sending one last, soft look towards him. “When you’re ready to talk…” “OUT!” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────As much as Harry wanted to see the good in people, he was getting very,  very tired of Draco. Their last class of the day had ended hours ago, and upon returning to the common room, a new note on the noticeboard caught the blonde’s eye— flying lessons would be beginning on Thursday— which had been a whole week away. Once the pureblood learned of Harry’s abysmally minimal knowledge of the sport, he had launched into a complete six-day lecture on every single detail about it. None of the other first-year Slytherins had been spared, and everyone— with the exception of Hermione, who was captivated by Draco’s thorough explanations— was just about ready to strangle the blonde in his sleep. Professor Malfoy’s gruelling long lecture about Quidditch went up all the way into Wednesday night, when each and every one of the first years in his dorm were willing to give up half their lifespan to learn the silencing charm. “As I was saying, the Snitch is evolved from the Golden Snidget—” “I swear to Merlin, Draco, if you do not  shut the bloody hell up , I will punch you so hard you won’t be able to attend Quidditch tomorrow.” Thanks to one Mr. Nott’s excellent choice of words, peace was finally granted to the first-year Slytherin dorm, in which all the snakes slept soundly, except for Draco, who sulked for about 10 minutes before falling asleep. Thursday morning came, and Harry counted his blessings. No one in the Slytherin dorms ever experienced a rude awakening, courtesy of the bright sunlight that would no doubt be prodding at students in the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw towers. Instead, a soft green glow ebbed the snakes out of slumber, like a mother gently shaking her child into consciousness. Schools of fish greeted the first-years as they roused, swimming past the arched windows decorating the walls of the dorm. While everyone bustled in and out of their shared bathroom, Draco announced random Quidditch facts to anyone who would listen (mostly Harry, as the green-eyed boy took pity on the blonde). The heir of House Malfoy was forbidden from being the first to use the bathroom, for no one else would be able to get ready on time if he hogged it for a whole hour. Draco had threatened to tell his father about it, but quickly shut up when Theodore promised to drag Professor Snape into it. There was no doubt that even though the potion professor was Draco’s godfather, the man would see the logic in the situation. “— and I nearly escaped by the skin of my teeth. Muggles are always so careless with their stupid airborne hell-copts—” “Helicopters,” Harry corrected, adjusting his tie. The boy had lost count of how many times the blonde recited his tale about encountering a helicopter while on a broomstick. Each and every version included a dramatic retelling of how the boy nearly lost his life. Draco rolled his eyes. “Whatever.” Down at the common room, Hermione was desperately memorising  Quidditch Through the Ages  from cover to cover, much to Daphne’s amusement. Tracey was listening to the muggleborn’s mumblings absent-mindedly. Even though the halfblood had never ridden a broom before, she didn’t look very concerned. The same could not be said for Hermione, however. On their way up to breakfast, Hermione bombarded Harry with facts from  Quidditch Through the Ages  while Draco interrupted every five seconds to pompously brag that he already told the green-eyed boy the information. The two were moments away from going at each other’s throats before Harry slotted himself in between them, with a warning look thrown in each direction. “My Gran’s sent me a Remembrall!” Neville announced excitedly as the three Slytherins passed the Gryffindor table. The boy was in the midst of explaining its purpose when the smoke inside the glass ball turned scarlet, making the Gryffindor falter. Unable to resist picking a fight, Draco snatched the glass ball from Neville’s hands, a natural sneer dancing across his lips. The blonde was in his element, a clever but scathing remark already worming onto the edge of his mouth—“Give it back, Malfoy,” said Harry and Hermione in unison, flocking at the sides of the blonde. Harry’s eyes were now a cool green, the boy staring at Draco calmly with no indication of backing down. Hermione was propping her book open with one hand while the other was perched on her hips, a frown gracing her mouth. Professor McGonagall, who could smell trouble faster than lightning, was stopped in her tracks. She had been on her way to diffuse the brewing situation, but the two snakes had been faster, leering out from their perches among the forest foliage. Grumpily, Draco handed Neville’s Remembrall back carelessly— although this awarded him with two identical glares. “Neville, you’ve forgotten your robes,” Harry provided helpfully, shooting the round-faced boy a smile before helping Hermione shepherd a scowling Draco back towards the Slytherin table. Three-thirty couldn’t come fast enough for Draco. When at last it did, the blonde ushered all of his yearmates out into the open land, too excited to whine about the sun and its effects on his pale skin. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass beneath was swaying gently in rhythm with nature, synchronised on every beat. Not everyone enjoyed the walk, however. Theo grumbled about having a better purpose for the time— spending it on his Transfiguration essay, for example, even though it was due in two weeks (Hermione agreed). Daphne would much rather be inside, playing a game of competitive, intense chess with one of the upper years (no one ever played twice against the girl, in shame of losing to an eleven-year-old). Pansy complained about how the wind was ruining her perfectly-styled hair and told anyone who’d listen about how long it took for her to style it that morning. The Gryffindors had yet to arrive, so the snakes allowed themselves to enjoy the light weather momentarily. Even Theo had to begrudgingly admit that it was a nice day out. The warmth of a breezy afternoon was a nice change from the chill of the stone-walled dungeons, and the feel of grass beneath them was a stark difference from the expensive carpets of the Slytherin common room. The sound of chatter made the Slytherins perk up in alertness. A flock of Gryffindors were rapidly advancing towards them, and the distraction of the lions was taken advantage of as the snakes took this time to recollect themselves. Robes were patted back into place and ties were adjusted. Not too long after the Gryffindors, Madam Hooch arrived. She had short, choppy grey hair, and lightning-coloured yellow eyes that scanned each of them like a hawk searching for an unsuspecting rabbit. “Well, what are you waiting for?” The woman barked. Harry thought this was rather crude— there was no introduction given, no safety precautions explained, no rundown of what they were about to do. “Everyone stand by a broom. Hurry up.” The students shuffled into places, Harry sandwiched between Draco and Hermione, as the two could not be trusted without something in between. Across him, Neville was trembling nervously. “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” instructed Madam Hooch, “and say UP!” “UP!” chorused twenty first-years. Only a few brooms bolted into the hands of the students, and Harry happily preened when he felt the rough surface of the old school broom in his palm. Draco’s had shot into his hand, as well, but Hermione’s had simply rolled over and stayed, rather like someone who didn’t want to get up in the morning. “Say it confidently,” whispered Harry to Hermione. He had a feeling that brooms were much like horses— they could feel when you were uneasy, and it made  them uneasy, too. “Easy for you to say!” hissed Hermione in return. She tried again, sounding a bit shaky but with a stronger tone in her voice. The broom wobbled a little before shooting into her hand, much to the muggleborn’s delight. Madam Hooch then demonstrated how to mount their brooms without sliding off at the end, going around to correct their form. The Gryffindors sniggered loudly when the teacher told Draco he had been holding his broom wrong for years— the Slytherins had the decency to muffle their laughs, though. The blonde flushed with embarrassment, turning redder when Harry patted his shoulder consolingly. “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard.” said Madam Hooch. Harry stared at her in bewilderment— was there no more briefing before they were sent into the air? “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, then land by leaning forward slightly. Ready? 1— 2—”  Neville, nervous and catalysed by the fear of being left on the ground while everyone soared up ahead, kicked off way too hard before the whistle even touched Madam Hooch’s lips. “Come back, boy!” yelled Madam Hooch. Harry had a minimum starting amount of respect for all his professors, but his respect for the flying instructor was dropping rapidly. Couldn’t she see that Neville had lost control of the broom? How could he be expected to come back down and land on his own, with no other instructions or help besides ‘Come back, boy!’? Neville was still rising, like there was a jet of water propelling him upwards with no sign of stopping. One glance down made the boy whiter than a ghost (Harry had a frame of reference for this, he saw the Bloody Baron rather frequently on his journeys into the Slytherin dungeons). The distance between the Gryffindor and the ground grew, and grew, and grew— fifteen feet— twenty feet— twenty-five— Second-hand fear slammed into Harry like a train as he saw Neville’s grip on the broom loosen. The boy’s mouth opened in a terrified ‘O’, and then Neville was slipping off the broom and plummeting towards the ground— Crack!  Neville landed harshly on the ground, hand reached out in a useless attempt to break the fall. All the colour drained out of Harry’s face. Why hadn’t Madam Hooch cast some sort of spell to soften the impact? Neville could’ve broken his neck and  lost his life ! The flying instructor rushed to Neville’s side, her face as white as his. “Broken wrist—” she murmured, “Alright, up with you, boy.” She then turned to the rest of the students, looking unprofessional in all her panic. “None of you are to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say   Quidditch. ” It was a good thing that Madam Hooch was much too distracted by Neville to get a good look around, for if she looked at her students carefully, she would’ve seen the dark glower Harry was sporting. The group of first-years watched until the figure of Madam Hooch and a limping Neville was a speck in the distance, wobbling bit by bit towards the castle. It made Harry even angrier— since the castle was so far away, shouldn’t some sort of medical tent be set up by the side for easy access in case of accidents? And from the looks of it, Neville probably injured his leg, as well— why was Madam Hooch making him  walk ?Harry was broken out of his thoughts by a rude laugh. “Did you see his face?” jeered Draco. Pansy joined in, but otherwise, the rest of the Slytherins were silent. The Gryffindors, however, were not so silent. “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil, one of the twins in their year. Harry absent-mindedly realised that a lot of people had been telling the blonde to shut up lately.  “Look!” said Draco suddenly, picking up something from the grass. He held it up for everyone to see— it was Neville’s Remembrall, glinting shinily under the afternoon sun. “It’s that stupid thing that Longbottom’s  gran sent him,” He said, sneering right in front of Ron Weasley, who flushed red in anger instantly. “Give it back, Malfoy! It’s not yours,” Ron snarled, making a leap for it. Draco was much too quick for him, though, and retracted the hand holding the Remembrall before Ron was even close. “I don’t think you can be trusted with holding such an item,  Weasley ,” mocked Draco. “Your family would fall into debt to pay for compensation if you broke it.” Clearly, family was not a line that could be stepped on in Ron’s book. While Harry did not have the same sentiments, he could see why the Gryffindor burned in fury. “Draco,” said Harry in a warning tone, but the blonde was enjoying himself too much to notice. “Maybe I’ll leave it up in a tree for Longbottom to find.” Draco said in a sing-song tone. “Better a tree than your hands, right Weasley?” “Draco, give it back.” said Harry, repeating the same warning tone. It was too late, though— Ron had risen to the bait and Draco had mounted his broom, ignoring Hermione’s hiss of: “You’ll get us all in trouble!”. “Oh, boy,” muttered Theo as Daphne shook her head exasperatedly. Even Tracey, who normally didn’t look bothered by anything, had an annoyed expression on her face. “There goes the Slytherin reputation.”No one could really hear what was going on, as both Ron and Draco were flying a decent height above the ground, their snappy conversation muffled by the wind. The Gryffindors had taken a very defensive, defiant stance, while the rest of the Slytherins (save for Pansy) were looking various stages of annoyed. Draco was single-handedly crafting a stereotype that the rest of his housemates would be scrutinised under. “Harry, do us all a favour and drag Draco down before he dooms us all for the rest of our seven years, won’t you?” said Daphne, rubbing her eyebrows tiredly. Harry stared at her stupidly. “You’re the one Draco will listen to,” supplied the silvery-blonde girl as an explanation. Beside her, Hermione looked uneasy, glancing in between Harry and the two in the air as if she were watching the finals for a tennis match.“I’ll… Uh… I’ll try.” Harry swallowed, summoning his broom wordlessly. The handle crested into his palm, warm and ebbing pulses of faint, bluish-gold magic. Little pricks prodded into the boy’s hand as he mounted his broom, taking a calming breath to settle his mind before kicking off. Much to his amazement, he rose steadily, and given a few seconds to adjust, he found that flying came rather naturally to him. It was as easy as breathing. There was an inbuilt instinct in him that just somehow  knew that leaning forward would push him up front, that tightening his grip would make him go faster, that twisting his thumb upwards would help him swoop towards the sky… Harry caught the final edges of Ron and Draco’s exchange as he circled and soared up towards them, the wind tousling his hair a settling sensation. Something in his bones echoed  home  and  family as he loosened his grip around the broom, finding within him a feeling he couldn’t remember. For a moment, Harry thought he heard the laughter of a woman, the terrified yowl of a cat, and the loud but undistinguishable chuckles of a man. “Give it  here , Malfoy!” growled Ron, face nearly as red as his hair. The Gryffindor clearly had experience under his belt with a broomstick— he hovered and moved to match the blonde, the two caught in a standstill where neither could get away— not with the quality of the school brooms. A wicked grin stretched across the blonde’s face. “Sure! Go  fetch .” “No—!” yelled Harry, but he was too late. Draco had tossed the Remembrall into the air, and right before the eyes of the three boys, it was falling, falling, falling… Stunned by Harry’s arrival, the two boys stared at him, attention drawn away from the plummeting glass ball. Harry wasn’t deterred, however, and followed the feeling that drummed away deep within him. Before he knew it, he had pointed his broom downwards, wind whistling in his ear and dancing along the crook of his neck, going straight into a steep dive— Somewhere not too far away, Harry could hear Hermione scream. The Remembrall was right within his reach, and without thinking it through, Harry unlatched one hand from his broom handle and reached out, a burst of satisfaction exploding in every one of his nerves when he felt the smooth surface of glass in his palm. Right before he crashed into the ground, he tugged the broom up, softening his blow as he tumbled into the cushioned grass. Instantly, he was rounded on by the rest of his classmates, although the lions held back a little. Theo offered him a hand to pull him up, and Hermione hugged him so tight that Harry thought his ribs were going to break. Daphne gave him a smile, which Harry took as a ‘Good job’. “Here,” Harry offered, holding out the Remembrall in his outstretched hand to Seamus Finnigan. “T-Thanks, Potter,” said Seamus awkwardly. Behind them, Ron and Draco landed, looking miffed now that they were no longer the main agenda at hand. Feeling a little breathless, Harry sunk back into the comfort of the warm grass. Flying came to him like breathing, but he enjoyed being planted to the earth, thank you very much. Now that his mind wasn’t so panicked, the reality of his actions were starting to slam into him. He— Harry Potter— a boy who had never ridden a broomstick before— had just dived what seemed like three storeys out of the sky.  “POTTER!” Harry’s heart dropped faster than the Remembrall did. Stomping over, looking very out of place among the green plains in his stark black robes was Professor Snape, a murderous look on his face. The dungeon bat was approaching rapidly in broad daylight, the flappy parts of his robes caught up by the breeze. Harry stumbled onto his feet, trembling and imagining the thousand ways the Dursleys would jeer at him when they found out he had been expelled. “What were you thinking?” Even though the professor looked like he was in the wrong habitat, he still managed to look very menacing, his lip curled in a sharp snarl. “Were you even thinking at all ?” “It wasn’t his fault, professor!” Harry spun to see the last person he expected standing up for him. Seamus Finnigan cowered slightly when the Head of Slytherin turned his glare onto him, but the boy stood his ground nonetheless. “He was only trying to catch Neville’s Remembrall, just— just like how he— he tried to help during p-potions...” “I agree, Professor Snape.” When Daphne spoke, she instantly captured the attention of everyone within a five-meter-radius. There was just something so elegant about the girl that it was difficult to look away. “Harry was only trying to help.” Theo and Blaise, behind the silvery-blonde, nodded their support. “That will be enough, Ms. Greengrass,” said Professor Snape curtly. “Mr. Potter. Follow me.” Just before turning to follow the potions professor, Harry caught sight of his classmates’ expressions. Draco looked as if he had just killed a puppy; Ron looked conflicted and slightly guilty; Hermione looked as if, well, she looked as if Draco had just killed a puppy in front of her. The rest of the Gryffindors looked uneasy and uncomfortable at how the situation had escalated, but said nothing more as the dungeon bat swept back across the green plains.  Just wonderful, Harry thought glumly as he meekly shadowed the professor.  Barely two weeks in and I’m about to be expelled.  Pass the front steps, up the marble staircase, through the winding corridors, and still Professor Snape didn’t say a word to him. Harry felt more and more miserable by the second, trotting as fast as possible after his Head of House, who walked with long, graceful strides and was not making any accommodations for Harry’s shorter legs. Maybe he was being taken to the Headmaster’s office— Harry wondered if he could be allowed to stay with Hagrid, who was expelled but worked on the grounds. As long as he could keep a foot in the magical world, Harry would be fine with lugging around Hagrid’s belongings and bathing Fang every day for the rest of his life. Eventually they stopped by a door, where the professor knocked twice sharply. The hinges swung open to reveal Professor Filtwick, left hand extended towards the doorway. “Good afternoon, Filius,” said Professor Snape stiffly. “May I borrow Flint for a moment?” Harry blinked. Flint? Was Professor Snape so mad that he was going to set Harry on fire before expelling him? As it turned out, however, Flint was not an object but a sturdy-looking fifth-year Slytherin, who glanced from the potions professor to Harry in confusion. “Am I in trouble?” said Flint, eyes still flicking around Harry’s small, tiny build, as if he were trying to remember if he beat up Harry earlier that week. “I didn’t do anything.” “No, Flint,” sighed the professor, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Follow me.” They marched up the corridor, Flint glancing at Harry every few seconds as if he were still trying to recall any altercation with the boy. “Professor!” Halfway up a staircase, another Slytherin boy joined them, eyes shining at Harry like he was more worth than all the gold in the world. “Is— is this him?” Once Harry took a longer look at him, he realised that he recognised the older boy— Terrence Higgs, the seventh year, the Slytherins’ Head Prefect. “Yes, Higgs,” said Professor Snape, sounding exasperated. “Please compose yourself.” Harry drooped even more. Terrence Higgs was the Head Prefect of his house, so it would make sense for him to be there while Professor Snape went through whatever paperwork or protocol required before he could be expelled. There was no doubt that Flint was probably some sort of important figure in the Slytherin house, too. Not only was Harry going to get expelled, he was going to get punished in front of  three people, as if the shame of being set away, two weeks into school, wasn’t bad enough. The Head of Slytherin led them into an empty, unused classroom, closing the door behind them before uttering some sort of spell under his breath. The doorknob clicked in confirmation, making Professor Snape nod in satisfaction. Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He was doomed for sure. “Potter,” said Professor Snape, grimacing as if he knew he was going to regret his next words for the rest of his life. “These are Marcus Flint and Terrence Higgs, our Quidditch captain and seeker. Flint, Higgs,” the professor paused, as if contemplating his decision. “This is your new reserve seeker.”Harry opened his eyes in shock. Whatever he had been expecting, it wasn’t that. Marcus blinked at the small boy. “... He’s tiny.” “I’m aware,” said the professor dryly. “Mr. Higgs, would you like to elaborate exactly why you came running at me ten minutes ago, demanding that I collect Mr. Potter from his flying lesson?” “Marcus, you should’ve seen the boy!” Terrence had no hesitation in jumping straight into his elaboration, eyes brighter than the North star. “I saw him from the library window— the trajectory of his dive— his streamlining— the way he pulled out from his  fifty-foot dive—” The brightness in Terrence’s eyes was infectious, apparently, for there was now a  spark in  Flint’s eyes. “A fifty-foot dive?” The captain whistled appreciatively. “Say, Potter— wasn’t today your first flying lesson?” Harry nodded numbly. Terrence looked as if all his dreams had come true, all at once. “Not bad, not bad…” Marcus nodded, surveying Harry’s build critically. “A bit small for his age, and we’d need to build up on some muscle…” “But he’s just about the perfect build for a seeker!” said Terrence, still grinning from ear-to-ear. “Light— speedy— with the right broom, he’d be the fastest player on the team!” “The rules state that first-years aren’t allowed to  own a broomstick.” Professor Snape pointed out with the twitch of a sly smile on the corner of his mouth. “There’s nothing against a first year using his captain’s spare broom.” If Marcus wasn’t excited before, he definitely was now. “We’d have to get him a good one— a Cleansweep Seven, maybe—”“Or a Nimbus Two Thousand—” interjected Terrence.“You mean we have to get  Flint a good spare broom,” the professor corrected slyly.Marcus smirked in return. “Of course, professor.” The potions professor’s gaze pinpointed onto Harry once more, serious and emotionless for a moment before the man allowed himself a slight smirk. “Minerva couldn’t look me in the eye for  two weeks  after we flattened her last year. Think you can make that happen again,  Potter ?” Honestly, Harry was so relieved that he wasn’t getting expelled that the professor could’ve told him to go bungee-jumping and he would’ve agreed instantly. “I’ll…  I’ll try, sir.” “Good .” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Apparently, picking fights with redheads was just something that was genetic in the Malfoy family. 

“The Malfoy-Weasley feud has been going on for years.” said Daphne breezily as she made another move on the chess board. The third-year opposite her (one of the ones bold enough to demand a rematch) was sweating profusely. 

“Why?” Unable to resist the curiosity, Harry planted himself next to Daphne, glancing through the chessboard in interest. 

The silvery-blonde tilted her head thoughtfully. “You’ll have to look through the old family records. Back in the old days, they used to record family feuds meticulously. It was a very big thing in those times.” 

Harry couldn’t figure out why anyone would record petty little feuds between families, but he supposed it was just one of the things he’d never understand. “Does your family have any… Current feuds with other houses?” Pureblood culture amazed him a million different ways, as some of the mannerisms were… Similar to Petunia’s. 

“Not at the moment, no.” Daphne said softly, eyes trailing over the chessboard. “That isn’t to say that we aren’t ‘siding’ with any houses. The House of Greengrass is quite well-connected with the family of Malfoy, for example. Since they’re in a feud with the Weasleys, we try not to get too involved with them to avoid getting in between the two houses.” 

“That makes sense,” Harry hummed. 

“I can lend you some books on our culture if you’d like,” offered Daphne. “Although you might have to wait for some, as they’re with Hermione at the moment. Oh, and 

checkmate

, dear.” 

The third-year collapsed in a heap of groans, wailing at the undeniable defeat. Harry quickly learned that Daphne was calm, cool, and collected on the outside, but when it came to chess— the girl was absolutely 

ruthless

. 

“Could I convince you to play a game with me, Harry?” Daphne asked sweetly, placing the pieces back in their starting places. 

“Err… I’m not very good,” confessed Harry with a slight blush on his cheeks. “But I’d like to try, if you could teach me.”  

And so they played. Harry lost pathetically to Daphne in every round, but by the fifth, he had a good idea of how Daphne was creeping her attacks up on him. The few times that he caught her set-ups, the silvery-blonde complimented him for his attentiveness (before proceeding to launch her 

second 

hidden attack). It was progress. 

“... Why’s Draco sulking like that?” Theo asked dryly at dinner, pointing to a pouting Malfoy at the end of their table. 

“Um… Professor Snape let me onto our Quidditch team as the reserve seeker,” Harry explained, feeling embarrassed. He had never been particularly good at sports in his previous school, and now that people seemed to be 

counting 

on him, he didn’t want to let them down. It was all very nerve-wracking. 

“Ah,” said Theo in understanding. “So he’s 

jealous

.” 

“Am not!” said the boy, who had obviously been listening in. 

Theo gave him a look that clearly said ‘Sure, keep telling yourself that’. Huffing angrily and crossing his arms, Draco returned to his sulking, mumbling about telling his father and having a talk with his godfather. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

In Draco’s books, a wizarding duel ruled over any disagreements, no questions asked. The two Slytherins had been heading back to the dungeons after dinner— although it was more Draco walking haughtily ahead while the other boy followed quietly. Disaster walked into them in the shape of one lanky, freckled Ron Weasley. 

“

Weasley

.” 

The sight of the redhead made Harry groan. It was as if there was absolutely 

no way 

to prevent Draco from sparking an argument when the Gryffindor boy was in sight. 

“

Malfoy

,” Ron snarled in return. 

“

Potter

.” Harry hissed under his breath. Unfortunately, he wasn’t as soft as he thought he was, because the other two turned to look at him as if he’d lost his mind. “Sorry, it was the only name left.” 

The Gryffindor shook his head, schooling his expression back to a dark one. “Where’re your henchmen, 

Malfoy

? What’re their names again— Lobster and Boyle?” 

“

Crabbe

 and 

Goyle

,” corrected Harry, “Boyle’s the guy who created the 

Boyle’s Law

.” 

Now the other two were looking at the green-eyed boy as if he spontaneously sprouted a second head. 

“If you’re so adamant on fighting me, 

Weasley

,” Draco continued, shaking his head to clear the nonsense that Harry had injected into his brain. “Then let’s do it tonight. A wizard’s duel. What, are you too scared to take up my offer? Makes sense— bet your family can’t pay for hospitalization fees if you get injured—” 

“Fine, 

Malfoy

,” gritted Ron, eyes blazing. “Tonight. Who’s your second?” 

“Harry,” said Draco easily, as if he hadn’t been fuming at the green-eyed boy minutes ago. “And yours?” 

The Gryffindor hesitated. “N-Neville.” He decided. 

“Then it’s settled,” said Draco with a sly smile. “We’ll meet at the trophy room, midnight. It’s not too late to back out if you’re 

scared

, 

Weasley

.” 

“You wish, 

Malfoy

.” 

“Yeah, 

Potter

.” 

Harry wore the most innocent expression he could muster when the two looked at him again. “Sorry, please go on. I just didn’t want to be left out.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

While Harry was happy that Draco was no longer mad at him, he had to ask: “Draco, what’s a wizard’s duel?” 

At the moment, he had an image of the blonde and the redhead wielding swords twice their height, yelling unintelligible war cries before charging at each other. The scene took a bit of a hilarious turn when both boys were dragged back by the weight of their weapons, face-planting onto the floor from the momentum. 

“I keep forgetting how little you know,” Draco harrumphed, although Harry didn’t think there was much bite in his words. “A wizard’s duel is between two or more wizards, where there are only wands allowed. There are many customs and etiquette involved. Wouldn’t expect someone like 

Weasley 

to know all the proper procedures.”

 “... Right…” Harry nodded, making a mental note to ask Daphne for some books on 

duels

. “And what was that other thing you said…? That I’m your second? What does that mean?” The questions just kept coming, and the blonde tutted in response, clicking his tongue disapprovingly. 

“It just means that you’ll take over the duel if I die.” Draco drawled, sauntering down the hallway towards the Slytherin dorms. Stunned, Harry halted in his steps, jaw dropping. 

“If you 

what

?” 

“If I die, Potter, and close your mouth. Your teeth are incredibly uneven and a headache to look at.” 

“Can we go back to the part where you 

die

?” 

Draco rolled his eyes, crossing his arms. “I don’t get why you’re making a whole fuss about it,” said the boy in a snarkish tone. “It’s not like I’m actually going to show up tonight, anyway.” Without another word, the pureblood left Harry in the dust, pushing past the silver snake into the common room. 

“You’re going to catch flies if you don’t close your mouth.” A kind voice broke Harry out of his trance. Walking down the corridor towards him, hair wrapped with a dark green shawl, arms laden with books, was Hermione, looking amused. “I just dropped by Professor Snape’s office to ask about the essay he gave us today, and he gave me a bunch of books! Want to share?” 

Harry paused, remembering how Aunt Petunia used to buy sweets to placate Dudley from throwing another tantrum. Smiling secretly to himself, he tried imagining Professor Snape with his head in his hands, waving carelessly at Hermione to take a stack of books to keep her occupied— momentarily. There was no doubt in his mind that the muggleborn would be at the professor’s office again the next day. Give it a few weeks, and Professor Snape would have a dropbox outside his door for Hermione to drop her inquiries into. 

“... Sure,” said Harry, distracted. 

Furrowing her brows, Hermione squinted at the other Slytherin, as if trying to figure out a puzzle. “Is there something wrong, Harry?” 

The boy hesitated, thanking the silver snake guarding the common room as he was ushered in. “... Well… Sort of. Say, ‘Mione…” 

“That’s 

awful

!” Hermione fumed, eyes ablaze with rage as Harry finished recounting the events of the night, including the continuation of the Malfoy-Weasley feud, as well as Draco’s underhanded plans. “It’s bloody awful, I’m going to—” 

“Keep it 

down

, Hermione,” hissed the boy, reaching out to grip the muggleborn’s wrist. The two were cuddled away in a corner of the common room, Professor Snape’s stack of books on the table before them. “Someone’ll hear you!” 

“Good!” snapped Hermione, glowering. “Then they’ll all know how 

underhanded

—” 

“Hey, what’s going on here?” said Seymour, who appeared out of nowhere, narrowing his eyes at the two first years. Harry had his hand clamped over Hermione’s mouth, and the girl was basically screaming death threats at Malfoy. For a moment, Harry considered that with her fiery demeanor, perhaps the muggleborn would’ve been better suited for a lion instead of a snake. 

“Nothing.” Looking strained, Harry managed the least-shakiest smile he could. Hermione struggled under him— and by 

Merlin

 was she strong— Harry was going red from the effort—

Seymour’s gaze shifted from Harry to the curly-haired muggleborn (still yelling profanities). For a moment, the prefect looked as if he was going to compliment how wide Hermione’s vocabulary was, in terms of swear words, but decided against it. “... Right. Keep it down. There are people trying to study.” 

“Yes. Sorry, sir,” Harry apologised, “

Keep it down, ‘Mione

.” 

After he was sure that the girl wasn’t going to strangle him, Harry removed his hand, eyeing Hermione cautiously. “I hate you so much,” she breathed, chest heaving from the effort. 

“Telling the entire house isn’t going to make things better,” rationalised the green-eyed boy. Grudgingly, the muggleborn nodded in agreement. “I say that we warn Ron not to meet Draco tonight. That way, no one’ll be in trouble, and… Well, Draco doesn’t need to know.” 

Hermione sighed sadly, eyeing her stack of reading material sorrowfully. “I was hoping to get started tonight…” She didn’t have long to mourn, however, as Harry got up and tugged on her wrist, pulling her along. 

As they clambered out of the Slytherin common room, Harry nodded seemingly at no one, saying: “We will, thank you.” The door slid close behind them with a soft 

thud

, the silver snake slithering back into place. Hermione glanced around wildly, bewildered. 

There was no other soul in the corridor, so who was Harry talking to? 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“You’ve got green ties,” said the Fat Lady, eyeing the two snakes suspiciously. “You look familiar,” she said, pointing to Harry, “but I’ve never seen you before.”

Hermione shrugged, her voice of reason having returned. “No, you haven’t.” 

“We’d like to speak to Ron Weasley,” Harry said politely, his neck starting to hurt from the strain of looking up. Whoever thought that it was a good idea to mount the portrait so high up… Well, he’d like to know what they were thinking. It made having conversation a very difficult task for a short eleven-year-old. “Is that alright?” 

“How did you two find your way here, anyway?” Ignoring Harry’s request, the Fat Lady squinted at the two. “You’re not supposed to be able to find this place.” 

“We tailed a Gryffindor,” answered Hermione honestly. “We don’t need to go in, we just need to 

talk 

to Ron Weasley. Could you please ask for him to come out?” 

“Why do you need to talk to my brother?” interrupted a new voice. The two snakes glanced up to see an older Gryffindor, diminished red hair and a stack of reference books in his arms. Hermione’s eyes glinted, as if she had just spotted one of her kind. “Did he get in some trouble?... Hold on a minute, you two are Slytherins!” 

“That’s right,” said Harry with his best-behavior smile. “No, he’s not in any kind of trouble,” 

yet

, “But we would like to talk to him, if it’s alright?” Harry could always tell the older Weasley to warn Ron against meeting Draco for a duel, but he wasn’t too sure about the weight duels carried in the wizarding world, and didn’t want to accidentally embarrass the redhead in the first year. Perhaps not showing up to a duel was a matter of great shame in the Weasley family. 

The older boy eyed the two suspiciously, distrustingly. “... Alright, a moment.” The Gryffindor made a shooing motion, and the two Slytherins backed away. Muttering a word under his breath, the older Weasley was granted access to the dorm, the Fat Lady slamming the portrait shut while glaring accusingly at the two green-tied students. 

“You!” said Ron Weasley, pointing his finger at Harry as he emerged from the portrait. “Why do you need to talk to me? What, are you Malfoy’s henchmen now?” 

“We’re not all men, you know,” huffed Hermione, crossing her arms. “But no, we’re not.”

“You can’t show up to the duel tonight,” explained Harry, watching an infuriated expression blossom across Ron’s features. “No, I’m serious. Draco isn’t planning on showing up—”

“— he might tip a teacher off—” added Hermione. 

“— to get you in trouble,” finished Harry, managing a slight smile in order to melt the hostilities between them. “We’re here to warn you. Hermione thinks it’s incredibly underhanded of Draco to play you like that, and I think so too.” 

The two snakes were startled when the redhead burst out into a mixture of a laugh and a scoff. “Are you kidding me? As if!” said Ron, turning his nose up at the two. “This is just Malfoy’s plot to get me to back down, isn’t it? Well, I’m not  a coward. You can go back and tell Malfoy that he’ll have to come up with a better lie next time.” 

The Gryffindor portrait slammed shut in the faces of the two, rendering them frozen with shock. 

“Well, that went… Horrible,” Harry winced, feeling dejected. He didn’t have a single clue as to what made him so distrustful in the eyes of his classmates. 

“There’s nothing we can do about it now, I suppose,” said Hermione, sighing. “We tried. Come on, Harry. It’s late. I don’t want to be caught out after curfew.” 

Even though she said that, Hermione tossed and turned in her bed that night, feeling restless. The clock on her bedside table ticked closer and closer to midnight, and the muggleborn wondered if Ron Weasley (and his second, Neville) were out roaming the corridors, in danger of being caught 

any second

. Unable to find sleep, she slipped out of her covers and into the common room, where there was already an occupant in the couch before the fireplace. 

“Can’t sleep?” asked Harry wryly. 

“Seems like we’re in the same boat,” replied Hermione. 

They sat in silence for a moment, filling the air with the sound of Professor Snape’s books. 

“I can’t take this,” breathed Harry dejectedly. “I keep… I keep thinking, what if they get caught?” 

“You know what?” Hermione said, suddenly determined. “Let’s go. It’s not too late yet, it’s almost midnight. We can try and catch them in the trophy room and send them back before they—” Before she finished her sentence, Harry was already setting his book down (not before bookmarking it, though), making his way to the door, Hermione on his heels. 

“We’ll be fine,” whispered Harry as the door shut behind them, slinking down the corridors, quiet as shadows. 

“... Clear,” said Hermione under her breath, sticking close to the green-eyed boy’s side as they approached the main corridors, eyes peeled for any teachers, ears twitching for the swish-swish-swish of Professor Snape’s robes. 

In some sort of magical miracle, the two managed to make it to the trophy room without getting lost. Harry pushed the door open, Hermione sliding it from the side. 

“Malfo—” Ron faltered, wand held high as it pointed in the face of someone he hadn’t expected. “... Why are 

you 

here? Potter’s Malfoy’s second, and— hey, where’s Malfoy?” Behind him, Neville was quivering, wand hand twitching in anxiety. 

“He isn’t coming,” said Hermione impatiently. “We told you before, didn’t we? You’ve got to go back to your dorms 

now

, we came to get you, go back before any of us get caught, or worse, expelled—” 

Down the hall came the sound of a 

meow

. 

“Mrs. Norris,” breathed Harry, face cold and pale. “We have to go. Now.” 

No one needed to be told twice. Ron tugged Neville along, Hermione and Harry peeking over the edge of the door and gesturing for the two lions to move when the coast was clear. However, it seemed as Mrs. Norris had already picked up on their scent— the sounds of her excited mewls were a dead giveaway. Hermione was really starting to regret carrying treats for the feline, for it was now bounding after them at full speed. 

“We’re dead, we’re dead, we’re dead…” rambled Ron, “Filch won’t be far behind…” And he was right— not too far behind the sound of Mrs. Norris was the scruff-scruff-scruff of Mr. Filch, who was dragging his feet because of his limp. 

“Students out of bed!” Mr. Filch was saying in glee, right around the bend. “Find them, sniff them out, my dear!” 

“In here, in here!” said Harry desperately, clutching at the first door they came across. “Oh, it’s locked— Mione—” 

The muggleborn didn’t have to be prompted any further. “

Alohomora

!” she hissed, jerking her wand at the door. It fell open with a 

clack

, the four first-years piling inside desperately. Harry and Ron pressed themselves up against the door, Neville whimpering as Hermione clenched her hand around her robes. 

Both Harry and Ron breathed a sigh of relief as the sound of Mr. Filch’s footsteps faded away, Mrs. Norris crying in despair as she lost the scent of the two snakes. The worst wasn’t over, however. 

“H… Harry…” Hermione said, painfully shaky and trembling in pure, undiluted fear. Neville was already frozen with terror, unable to utter a single word. 

The green-eyed boy felt his blood turn to 

ice 

as he looked at what the girl was pointing at. A great, great, three-headed dog, all six eyes fixated on the four students, drool dripping from every one of their jaws. 

“Oh,” Harry gulped, swallowing, 

willing 

something in his body to move. “He, er… 

They 

look hungry…” 

“Bloody Merlin,” said Ron, white as a sheet. “What is 

that

?” 

“Think you can work your charm on 

this 

animal?” whispered Hermione, not daring to take her eyes away from the Cerberus. “Please tell me you can. Please.” 

“We need to go. We need to go, 

now

!” Harry said, his breathing picking up. He had read somewhere that dogs were capable of picking up on 

panic

, so he was very sure that the Cerberus— with all three noses— could smell that he was 

doused 

in it.

The Cerberus must’ve gotten tired listening to their conversation, because it snarled and flexed all three of its jaws.

 “Run!” screamed Hermione, and everyone pushed back against the door, slamming it shut as they scampered down the corridors, panting and heaving until they were a good distance away from the room. It was a wonder no teacher came across them, for they made a clamour, alright. 

“Guess we know what’s on the third corridor,” Ron said weakly as they finally caught their breaths. 

Neville looked like he would faint if someone so much as poked him. 

“We wouldn’t have known if 

someone 

had listened!” hissed Hermione, angry now that the initial adrenaline had worn off. “We could’ve 

died

 in there—” 

The Gryffindor looked away guiltily. “W-Well,” he said, stuttering, “h-how was I to know you weren’t lying?” 

“That’s enough, ‘Mione. We should get back before we get caught,” said Harry, hand gripping Hermione, who was probably one more remark away from mauling the redhead. So much for a Slytherin's subtlety. “You guys should head back too. Night.” 

The last word was really more of a courtesy than anything, because Harry didn’t imagine that 

anyone 

could fall asleep after staring into the eyes of the Cerberus. Glowy, yellow orbs, like worn street lamps, dotting down the street. Bubbled saliva dripping from stained fangs, each about the size of a flower vase. Every detail of the creature was imprinted into Harry’s mind, and he didn’t think he was going to get any sleep for a while. 

Harry, however, forgot an important detail. He was, after all, a small eleven-year-old, and when eleven-year-olds have been up all night worrying their heads off about their classmates, sneaking through the castle near midnight, and running away from a murderous three-headed-dog, they get pretty worn out. Within seconds after meeting his pillow, Harry fell into slumber to the sound of Draco’s snores, wondering about what tomorrow would bring.

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────After the night of the non-existent midnight duel, Harry  swore  to avoid the third-floor corridor like a bloody plague. He would take detours around half the school, having to  run to his classes just so he could steer clear of the staircase leading towards Cerberus’s territory. Hermione wasn’t much different. The two snakes swore to set themselves onto their academics, to studiously go through the material Professor Snape had unloaded onto the muggleborn, to prepare for their exams three months in advance. Draco was disgusted by such behaviour, of course, but Theodore was  delighted . Study groups and discussions started being commenced in the common room where they would debate the limits of magic and the flaws of the syllabus. Daphne, halfway through with demolishing a seventh year’s chess defence, would offer input occasionally. The next excitement came a week later, although this one was comparatively less dangerous than discovering a hungry three-headed dog. None of the boys (with the exception of Theodore, who had absolutely no interest in Quidditch) could resist feeling jealous at the discovery of a long parcel at the end of Harry’s bed, signed with the initials  S.S . They had just returned from dinner to see the neatly-wrapped package sitting quietly, gently coaxing for them to come closer. News of Harry’s appointment as reserve seeker had quickly flitted around the Slytherin ranks, so no one (not even Crabbe and Goyle) had to ponder long about the mysterious package. “Open it!” urged Draco, who was looking a mixture of envy and excitement. The parcel unravelled on Harry’s bedspread, triggering a resounding echo of gasps. Even Harry, who didn’t have much comparison in brooms, could tell that it was a gorgeous model. The handle was sleek, shiny, polished mahogany, glinting under the green glow of the underwater dorms.  Nimbus Two Thousand was embedded into the handle, painted a shimmering gold that shone no matter the lighting. The twigs were neatly combed back, aligned, smooth, and straight. “Whoa,” said Crabbe and Goyle in unison. “There’s a note.” Blaise pointed, spotting a small, folded piece of parchment tucked, half-hidden in the packaging. 
 Flint & Higgs will meet you at the pitch, 7 pm tonight. Do   NOT   be tardy. - S.S
“I hate you so much right now!” huffed Draco, crossing his arms angrily. “I must write to Father  at once , I—” The boy didn’t get to finish. “We know, Draco,” said Theodore, rolling his eyes. He was the only one unaffected by all the excitement, only having glanced up from his book once, looking uninterested. “Run along now, go start that letter so we don’t have to listen to your whining any longer.” Stomping his foot childishly, the pureblood did as he would, making a racket as he left the dorm rooms. There was no doubt that if Seymour was down at the commons, Draco would receive a scalding lecture about his behaviour. “Oh, hi Harry,” said Hermione, who bumped into the shorter boy in the corridors going up from the dorms. She was probably on her way back from pestering the potions professor with questions. Doing a quick once-over at Harry, with his excited fidgeting and bright eyes, she swiftly deduced his activities of the night. “... Be careful.” “I will, I will.” Harry nodded hurriedly, waving as he continued down the corridors, glancing around in order not to bump into any students. It wouldn’t take long for anyone to figure out what he was doing, not if he was seen walking around with a broomstick in hand. At ten to seven, Harry was joyfully stumbling his way over the plains towards the Quidditch pitch, the path lit by the setting sun. The dusk enveloped him in soft, warm hues, pinks and oranges, and the boy felt like his day just couldn’t get any better. The weather was light and breezy— just  perfect for his first fly with his Nimbus. The stadium towered over him, making Harry stare around in awe. Thousands and thousands of seats surrounded the pitch, and the boy remembered that Hermione mentioned magic being used to raise the seats during matches so that the audience could see the flying players better. At either side of the court were fifty-meter loops that looked like the sticks kids blew bubbles through, except about a hundred thousand times bigger. Neither Marcus nor Terrence were anywhere in sight, but Harry was much too eager to fly again to have patience. He kicked off the ground, relishing in the first taste of wind in his face. Crows cawed in the distance, and he joined them in the skies, going a few laps around the full court to gauge the length. He flew through the loops, swerved and dived around the pitch, feeling adventurous enough to go faster, the adrenaline overwhelming his what-ifs. “Who—?” Harry nearly jumped off his broom in shock when he realized he wasn’t alone. Feeling shy all of a sudden, the boy swooped down and landed much better than he did his first time, staring into the face of one very shocked Oliver Wood. “That… That was  excellent  flying,” said the older boy, eyes wide and jaw gaping. He was only sneaking out for a few laps before bed and hadn’t been expecting to witness absolutely  spectacular talent. “You been flying since you were born or something?” “N-No, sir.” Even in the dark, Harry could tell his face was flushed, partially because of the exercise and partially because he was embarrassed. “T-That was my second time.” Oliver’s jaw unhinged. “Your  second  time? By Merlin, you’re a natural— I would  kill to have you on the Gryffindor team right now— damn it, you’re a Slytherin, aren’t you?”“HEY! GET AWAY FROM HIM!” Before Harry had a chance to answer, there was a yell from the side of the pitch, coming from a fuming Marcus Flint, who looked as if he was going to charge Oliver like an angry bull. Meanwhile, the Gryffindor Quidditch captain simply pursed his lips, brows twitching in annoyance. Terrence wasn’t far behind, jogging in right on Marcus’s tails. “I wasn’t aware that Slytherin booked the pitch tonight,” said Oliver, tauntingly. “If I had known…” Clearly, no one had been informed because Marcus wanted to keep Harry on the down-low, wanted to keep their secret weapon  secret . “Shut up,” growled Marcus, wand already in hand. “Marcus,” warned Terrence, ever the rational mind. There was no surprise that the boy was made Slytherin’s Head Prefect— he had stellar grades, a good sense of justice, and on top of that, a logical head on his shoulders. Thankfully, the Slytherin captain lowered his wand, but he didn’t lower his glare. “Get lost, Wood.” “Hmm…” the Gryffindor sighed, tapping his chin as if contemplating. “I don’t think I will. You didn’t book the pitch, did you? That means it’s my right to be here if I wish to be.” Harry was wondering if Oliver Wood should have been a Slytherin instead. Terrence seemed to be thinking the same thing, although he looked ten times more exasperated than the younger boy did. “You—” said Marcus, teeth grinding against each other. Harry couldn’t help but whimper and shrink into himself when the older boy raised his arm, about to throw a punch. Naturally, Oliver raised his arms as well, prepared to defend himself just in case. Their taunting and arguing got louder and louder, and Harry’s desire to  run grew exponentially with the increase in volume. All of a sudden, however, both Oliver and Marcus were silenced— their mouths were still moving, but nothing was coming out. “That’s enough,” Terrence interrupted firmly, having pulled Harry behind him. His wand was raised in a display of the Slytherin seeker’s ability to cast  Silencio  non-verbally. “Harry, could you go do a couple of laps around the pitch, just for a while? I’ll call you down when we’re  ready .” His words carried a cold tone about them as he glared at the two captains frigidly, almost as if he was challenging them to argue. The first-year obeyed instantly, grateful to have an outlet for the desire of run . As soon as he was far enough, Terrence settled the fiercest glare he was capable of producing on the two, ready to chew them out completely. Never in all his years at Hogwarts had the seventh-year ever used this demeanour with any younger students, as he normally believed reasoning was the best method to approach conflicts. “You’re fifth-years, by  Circe  .” he snarled, narrowing his eyes at the two. “Is it too much to ask for both of you to  act  with the appropriate level of maturity? And for Merlin’s sake, can’t the two of you be a little more conscious about your surroundings! One moment longer and Harry would’ve started running for hills  because of you two !” At least the two captains had the decency to look guilty. Terrence took a breath to recompose himself, letting his typically calm posture overtake once more. “Wood, you’re free to stay, but I’d request for you to stay out of our way. I probably can’t ask you to keep this information away from your own team, but  please don’t go around announcing what you saw here tonight to the other houses.” “Fair enough,” said Oliver, shrugging. “And  Marcus  ,” said Terrence, stressing on the word. “  Please refrain from getting physical in front of Harry… If you know what I mean.” It took a moment, but something clicked in the Slytherin captain’s head. “You don’t mean…” Marcus’s eyes widened in shock. “It’s not all that uncommon. Not in our House,” said Terrence lowly. “Wood… If you understand what we’re insinuating, I’d ask for you not to go around telling everyone as well."The Gryffindor picked up on the message much faster, nodding stiffly once the full weight of the underlying message settled. Now understanding exactly how large an effect their actions carried, both captains looked uncomfortable, wishing they hadn’t started arguing in the first place. “If you two can agree to act civilly, I’ll call Harry down,” Terrence spoke, rubbing the bridge of his nose.The green-eyed boy swooped back down onto the pitch when he was called, eyeing the two captains meekly, as if he expected them to start a brawl any moment now. If Terrence noticed Harry’s shifty glancing, he blatantly ignored it and opened the wooden box he had carried into the pitch with him. “Do you know how Quidditch works, Harry?” asked Terrence. He grinned in approval when the younger boy nodded shyly. “Alright, then. Can you explain to me, briefly, how the game is played?” “Seven players on each team,” said Harry, reciting all he knew about Quidditch, courtesy of Professor Malfoy’s long lectures. “Three chasers, two beaters, one keeper, one seeker. The chasers are in charge of throwing the Quaffle at each other until it gets through one of the three hoops, kinda like basketball in the air.” The boy pointed at the soccer-sized, bright red ball in the middle of the case. Terrence stifled a laugh when he spotted how confused Oliver and Marcus looked at the mention of ‘basketball’. The seeker leaned over the box, picking up the Quaffle and tossing it to Harry, who caught it with a soft  oof . “That’s right, just like basketball in the air. Here, hold it for a bit.” Harry flushed in embarrassment when he realised the reference he made, his fingers running over the slanted sides of the Quaffle. “Um, and the keeper is in charge of guarding the opponent’s hoops, preventing them from scoring. Each Quaffle through a hoop is worth ten points.” The three older boys hummed in agreement, gesturing for the first-year to keep going. “And… Each team has two beaters, who are in charge of protecting their team against the Bludgers, which zoom around trying to knock people off. They’ve got these… Short baseball bats to hit the Bludgers with.”  “Yes, that’s right,” nodded the older seeker, looking amused at the captains’ growing confusion. “I’m not going to take the Bludgers out tonight, don’t want to give you a concussion.” “H… Has anyone ever… You know…  Died from getting hit by a bludger?” asked Harry timidly. Smirking, Terrence flicked his gaze towards Oliver, who looked away instantly. “I seem to remember a second-year Gryffindor getting hit in the head by a bludger, two minutes into the first game of the season…” Marcus snorted. “I seem to remember said Gryffindor being unconscious for one whole week, too.” “Shut up!” grumbled Oliver, looking a little red. “But no, in Hogwarts’ history, no one has  died ,” said Terrence quickly once he spotted how white Harry had turned. “Don’t worry too much about it. We’ve got Bole and Pucey on our team— they’ll protect you from the Bludgers.” The green-eyed boy didn’t look very reassured, but he continued. “Then there’s the seeker,” Harry said, getting a little excited. His cheeks were flushed a light red, and his hair was tousled by the wind. “Whose job is to catch the Golden Snitch, which was derived from a Golden  Snidget  . Catching the Snitch awards the team a hundred-fifty points, which  normally wins the game.” “It doesn’t always, though,” Marcus said, “If one team is more than two hundred points ahead when the snitch is caught by the other, it’s not possible for the snitch-catching team to win. I think an example of this was Ireland vs. Japan’s game, which also happens to be the longest game in all recorded Quidditch matches.” “It lasted for three months, didn’t it?” Oliver hummed thoughtfully. “Yeah,” Terrence nodded. “They had to keep bringing in substitutes so that the players could sleep and eat. Japan was two-hundred-thirty points ahead when Ireland caught the snitch, which makes an eighty point difference— Japan’s win.” “Whoa,” said Harry, looking amazed. “Anyway, that was pretty impressive! I thought you didn’t know much about Quidditch— did you do some reading before you came down here?” joked Terrence cheerfully. This made the younger seeker blush as he looked down at his feet, trying not to mumble. “Draco told me all about Quidditch when he found out I’d never played it before.” Terrence chuckled good-naturedly, leaning down over the case once again. “Here’s the snitch,” he said proudly, holding the gold-coloured object the size of a walnut, its feather-thin wings flapping rapidly, protesting against the seventh-year’s grip. “Do you want to hold it?” “Y-Yes, please,” said Harry, eyes bright. The boy gasped as the golden ball was passed to him fluttering upon his palm, buzzing warmly, desperate to start whizzing around at two hundred miles per hour. “Whoa.” “We won’t be practicing with the Snitch just yet,” explained Terrence, feeling unreasonably happy at the younger boy’s excitement. There was just something about Harry’s young, boyish innocence that was oh-so-contagious. “It’s normally easier to see when the sun’s out and it’s bright, cause you can normally find it by looking for the glint as the light reflects off of it. For tonight, we’ll use these, instead,” he said, retrieving a half a dozen identical, neon-green, golf-sized balls from his pocket. “So we won’t lose the Snitch in the dark.” Without warning, the seventh-year launched a ball at Harry, who moved and caught the ball by reflex. Terrence hummed in approval. “Not bad, you’re good! Marcus, take some— Wood, will you help or are you just going to stand there the whole time?” Terrence handed out a bunch of the balls to the other two, and they all got onto their brooms. Once they were at a decent height, they took turns throwing balls at Harry from all directions, watching as the boy zoned into a focus, swerving left and right, not missing a single ball. “I really, really hate the Sorting Hat right now,” grumbled Oliver as Harry caught his hundredth-or-so ball of the night.  Marcus snorted. “Alright, Harry, that’s enough. It’s getting quite late, we should get back before Professor Snape comes out personally to drag us back,” said Terrence with a soft laugh. For a moment, Harry considered if the professor had actually done so before— it seemed like the older seeker was speaking from personal experience. “It’s getting pretty dark, anyway.” The boys marched back towards the castle, Marcus and Oliver getting into a light argument about their favourite Quidditch teams while Terrence shepherded his successor up over the plains. Harry was worn out from all the exercise he had gotten, and now that the blood rush was over, the boy was exhausted, and if left alone, could probably fall asleep on the grass. “Think you can make your way back to the dorms?” asked Terrence quietly, hand on Harry’s shoulder to steady him. They had split paths with Oliver, who had gone upwards while the rest of them descended into the depths of the castle. “I think so,” Harry yawned, reaching up to scrub his eyes.The older seeker scowled, swatting Harry’s hand away. “Don’t do that. Your eyesight is bad enough as it is, don’t make it any worse. Marcus and I need to head over to Professor Snape’s office for a bit. Be careful on your way down, got it?” Harry nodded groggily, yawning again as he turned down the corridor. Once he was out of eyesight, the Quidditch captain and the seeker turned to look serious. There was only one thing on their mind, and Professor Snape  had to know about it. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────“You’re back later than usual today,” commented Percy, not looking up from his book as Oliver stepped into the fifth-year Gryffindor’s dorm. The rest of their housemates were already asleep, burrowed under the covers as the months got colder, leaving only Percy, propped up against the headboard, half-covered by his blankets. “Did something happen down at the pitch?” “... Percy.” “Hmm?” “I really want to burn the Sorting Hat into pieces right now.” This caught the redhead’s attention. “Where did this impulse come from, all of a sudden?” he asked, one eyebrow raised tentatively. Oliver stumbled over, flopping onto the side of Percy’s bed, ignoring the other boy’s displeased sigh. For every time that Oliver, all sweaty from a night fly, threw himself onto Percy’s bed, the redhead would complain but never had he ever pushed the captain away. “I hate it so much. So much,” Oliver sighed dejectedly. “It gave Slytherin the best seeker I’ve ever seen since your brother.” Humming softly, Percy picked up his book again, shifting to the side so the captain would have space. Oliver didn’t need any prompting, shuffling until he was tucked under the covers next to the prefect. “Who?” asked Percy. “Harry Potter,” Oliver mumbled, sounding sad. “Harry bloody Potter. It was his second fly today!  Second !” Even though Percy didn’t have much of an interest in Quidditch, Oliver did, and the redhead had learned, throughout the years of their friendship, that he didn’t really mind listening. “Oh?” Despite not really knowing what the darker-haired boy was going on about, Percy prompted him on. “His form! It’s  beautiful  — some people need years to get into that form, but he— he’s a bloody natural,” Oliver continued ploughing on even as the redhead cast a  Silencio around his bed. “He’s just the right build for a seeker— small, light, too…” The prefect hummed to show he was still listening, flipping through his book absent-mindedly. After a while, however, he noticed that Oliver had fallen silent, replaced with the soft, occasional snore. Percy smiled fondly, setting his book down onto his nightstand, folding his glasses on top of the cover. As he slid into the blanket, Oliver moved in his sleep, looping his arms around the lankier of the two. Just before he closed his eyes, Percy wriggled within the other boy’s arms, turning to his side so he could see Oliver’s snoring face. Pressing a soft kiss onto the captain’s forehead, the redhead smiled happily, snuggling into the warmth of the other. “Night, Quidditch fanatic.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Time seemed to pass by like a swift spring breeze. Caught up with his classes, work, and now Quidditch practice, Harry realised with a start that he had been at the castle for about two months now. The stone corridors felt more like home than Privet Drive ever did, less cold now that Terrence had been so kind to weave warming charms into the hems of Harry’s uniforms. A warm buzz filled Harry’s ribs at the thought of the green-themed common room, soft cushioned couches, towering, glowing glass windows. “Good evening,” greeted Harry softly as he stepped into the library, closing the doors behind him quietly. His bookbag was slung over his shoulder, filled to the brim with notebooks (Theodore brought extra) and bits of parchment. Madam Pince looked up from her work, glancing at him over the rim of her glasses. “Good evening, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling at the sight of the kind Slytherin boy who frequented the library on a daily basis. “Are we doing research today?” “Yes, miss,” said Harry with an excited smile, although he was careful not to get too loud. “Professor Flitwick said in class we could get extra credit if we added some research into our essay. It’s about the mechanics of levitation, I’m planning to look into how gravity is countered by magic.” The librarian nodded. “There should be some good reference materials around aisle 34,” she provided helpfully. “Have fun researching, Mr. Potter.” “I will, miss. Thank you!” Harry beamed, scurrying off to get started. Soon enough, he had collected a good stack of references, a tower of books about a head taller than Harry himself. Happily, the boy arranged his material on an empty table and got to work. Too engrossed in his research, Harry never noticed when he was joined at his table. “Are you writing an essay on the mechanics of levitation?” said Percy Weasley, startling the boy out of his focus zone. The redhead watched curiously as Harry’s face exploded with blossoms of red, caught unaware and off-guard. “Y-Yeah,” said Harry, still flustered. He hadn’t expected someone to approach him out of nowhere. “Alright if I sit?” Percy asked, drawing out a chair opposite the Slytherin boy. He had a bag of his own, filled with parchments that were folded neatly, a contrast to Harry, who simply stuffed his things in a hurry. The prefect’s initial plan was to head to the library for some light studying in the silence that the Gryffindor tower sorely  lacked — however, when he saw the dark-haired Slytherin, he recalibrated his course out of curiosity. “... Is this for extra credit?” “Y-Yeah,” stammered Harry. “Professor Filtwick said… Said that he would award extra marks on the essay if we threw in some research of our own.” The conversation ended there for a while, with Percy turning to his own work, and Harry back at his essay, scribbling furiously with his quill. It wasn’t until half an hour later that one of them spoke. “W… Would it be alright if you looked over my essay for a bit?” asked Harry shyly, head bowed and tousled dark locks in his eyes. “Um… I’m not very sure about the accuracy of my information, a-and I heard that you’re really good at Charms... Y-You don’t have to,” he added hurriedly, “But I was just hoping—”“Hand it over,” interrupted Percy, setting down his quill. Pushing his glasses up, he scanned over the parchment swiftly, going line by line while Harry fidgeted nervously on the other end of the table. “... This is pretty good work, considering your age. There’s room for improvement here, though.” He gestured for Harry to lean over for a closer look, “See this? You can rephrase this better, like so…” Fifteen minutes later, Harry was staring down at his corrected essay in awe. Percy’s remarks had made the essay a lot easier to comprehend, getting the message across straight away without straying away from the initial point. “Thank you so much!” Harry beamed, feeling infinitely grateful. Percy shrugged. He was starting to understand why Oliver had developed a bit of a soft spot for the Slytherin boy. “It’s not a problem,” he said, the corner of his lips quirking. “... You know, if you want, I could show you some more complex charms, just for fun…”“Really?” The Slytherin boy’s eyes had gone completely wide, large orbs of emerald green staring up at Percy, three-quarters a meter shorter than the redhead. “You’d do that?” “Sure,” said the redhead, already collecting his books. “Come on, Potter. Get your things.” Eagerly, Harry shoved his notebooks and parchment into his bookbag, skipping after the older energetically. Madam Pince raised an eyebrow as the two boys walked by, the shorter of the two grinning like Christmas had come early. “Give me a piece of spare parchment,” said Percy, who couldn’t help but stand up straighter now that he had someone to impress. Obediently, Harry rummaged into his bag, digging out a piece of torn paper for the prefect. “ Avifors !” Eyes sparkling in amazement, Harry watched as the piece of paper folded itself into the shape of a bird, twittering in the middle of Percy’s palm before taking flight around the empty classroom the prefect had let them into. “Whoa!” he breathed, alit with awe. “That’s so cool!” Percy puffed his chest a bit more at the praise. “You’ll be able to learn that in your third year,” he said proudly. “I-Is there something you could teach me?” said Harry, “We haven’t really started casting anything in Charms yet, b-but—” “I don’t see why I can’t,” said Percy, straightening his shoulders. “They say that if you’re smart, you can teach  anyone  anything.” Harry nodded hurriedly in agreement. “S-So, can you teach me?” “Of course,” Percy huffed. “I’m the top scorer in my Charms class.” “T-Then, could I learn something like…” Harry searched his mind for something that would be useful. “Maybe, um… How to conjure water? Can we do that?” Pondering on it for a moment, Percy nodded finally. “I don’t see why not. It’s a bit advanced, though,” he warned, “Don’t be surprised if you can’t get it. Look carefully at my wand movements, alright? You want to make it nice and smooth, kind of curvy, too. Like this.” Harry mimicked the older’s movements, preening when the prefect hummed approvingly. “Alright, now you just need to say the incantation at the same time as the movement.  Aguamenti ,” Percy instructed, nodding when Harry repeated and pronounced it correctly. “Magic is 10% technique, 30% skill and 60% will.” The younger boy nodded, recognising the advice as Professor McGonagall’s words. “ Aguamenti  !” said Percy commandingly, marvelling Harry as a stream of water burst from the tip of his wand, flopping in the air until the redhead commanded it into a sphere. “Making the water make shapes is all about  control ,” he explained, “You’ll need a steady hand and a firm mind to get it to work for you. For now, just focus on getting the charm to work. Are you ready to try?” Harry held his wand up, taking a deep breath to calm his nerves. “Yeah.” “Go for it, then,” said Percy, flicking his wand absent-mindedly, forming a shield so he wouldn’t get hit if Harry  did conjure some water. The green-eyed boy readied himself, his expression changing into a determined one. He pictured a stream of water in his mind, shooting out from his wand towards the centre of the classroom. In the depths of his mind, he could hear Percy’s surprise and congratulating approval. “ Aguamenti !” he said, following the wand movement the prefect had shown him earlier. A jet of water sprinkled upwards from the tip of Harry’s wand, shooting up like fireworks and dissipating into tiny droplets, making it rain lightly. Percy’s jaw dropped in surprise as his shield beeped, alerting him that it had been hit. Face alight with glee, Harry turned, hair damp with the success of his first try. “I did it!” Harry exclaimed giddily. “You did it…!” Percy gaped, still caught in a web of shock. If he was being frank, he was expecting a few measly drops from the boy, nothing more— but apparently, Harry bloody Potter wasn’t just a natural at Quidditch, he was a natural at  magic , too. “You’re the bestest teacher, Mr. Percy!” cheered Harry, too delighted to feel shy around the older boy. “Can I practice that again? Or can we learn something else?” 
 How could Percy ever say no after being praised like that?  
“Alright,” said Percy, looking determined, “We’re going to learn  Lumos next.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Before Harry knew it, the end of October was approaching, and with it came Halloween. It had never been a significant event in Harry’s childhood, simply because the Dursleys locked him inside while Dudley went out trick-or-treating in the neighbourhood. They kept him in the cupboard for the whole night, saying that he would steal sweets from the kitchen if given the slightest chance. 
 “What are you dressing up as, Harry?” said Dudley’s snide voice. “An orphan? Oh wait, you don’t need to dress up for that.”  
Now that he knew October 31st was the day his parents died— Harry was looking forward to Halloween even  less . In fact, he didn’t think he’d want to do anything but bury himself in his bed, surrounded by his own misery and perhaps a book or two. He began wondering: What if? What if his parents hadn’t died? Would they have been proud of him in Slytherin? Would they have been proud of him, the youngest reserve seeker in Hogwarts’ history? Would they have sent sweets for Halloween? Harry sighed, getting out of bed. There was no use lingering on the ghosts of the dead, he supposed. Besides, it wasn’t as if he remembered much about his parents anyway— what was there to miss if he couldn’t even remember what they looked like? Still feeling a little down, Harry trudged down to the common rooms, bookbag thrown over his shoulder, filled with his textbooks of the day, as well as their corresponding notebooks and spare parchment. Their first class of the day was Potions, which Harry looked forward to— brewing came pretty naturally to him, and it was almost as relaxing as flying a lap around the pitch. “Harry!” The boy looked up to see Terrence walking over, a warm grin on his face. “Just reminding you, in case you forgot— Quidditch tryouts today, 3.30pm. Do be on time.” It was mandatory for Quidditch members to attend the tryouts, in case someone on the team could be switched out for a better, auditioning player, and to make sure the new players had a good dynamic with the existing ones. It simply wouldn’t do if the new player was talented  but couldn’t get along with their teammates. “I will,” replied Harry. As if he could forget about the tryouts— as if  Draco would let him forget. The blonde had been going on and on about how he was going to try out, because since Harry was on the team, no one could say that first years weren’t allowed to try out for the position. However, it seemed as though Draco had changed his mind after a particularly scathing remark from Theodore— something about the professor’s high standards? Harry hadn’t really been listening. “Good. I’ll see you there, then. Have a nice day at class, kid,” Terrence said warmly, giving the younger seeker a pat on the back before walking off, possibly to join his classmates. Harry was still a bit too caught up in his thoughts to notice that he didn’t flinch when touched anymore. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────He didn’t mean to, but Harry was starting to question his professor’s common sense. Some of Professor Flitwick’s relatives would be in Scotland for a brief trip the next day, and the Charms professor had decided that, instead of cancelling the Slytherin class, he would mash up the green-decked students with the lions, instead. The dark-haired boy couldn’t figure out for the  life of him why the stout man thought a joint lesson between the two houses with the most rivalry was a good idea.  To make things better, in order to promote ‘inter-house friendships’, Professor Flitwick had paired each Gryffindor with a Slytherin, clapping his hands in delight when they matched up nicely. Harry, thanking Merlin, had gotten Seamus, who didn’t seem all that bothered about working with him. Hermione and Ron, however, a row of tables below Harry, weren’t very pleased about the arrangement. “Now, keep in mind the hand movement we practiced!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, standing on top of his table at the front of the classroom, demonstrating as he spoke. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick! Pronunciation and enunciation are very important, too! Remember Wizard Baruffio!”“Would you like to go first?” asked Harry, gesturing for Seamus to go at the feather. Percy had let him practice the spell with a piece of parchment, then a book, just to amp up the challenge. Both times, Harry successfully levitated the objects in his first three tries, much to the prefect’s growing delight. Seamus nodded, swishing and flicking as he could, Harry ducking wherever needed to avoid getting jabbed in the eye. The emerald-eyed boy winced as the Gryffindor prodded angrily at the feather, nearly jumping out of his seat in alarm when Seamus lit it on  fire .  “ Aguamenti  !” said Harry, thankful that Percy taught him the spell. A small burst of water extinguished the to-be-disaster on their table. The feather drooped, having just been doused. “Here, let me show you.  Wingardium Leviosa !” To Seamus’s astonishment, the feather lifted steadily off the table, dripping as it went higher and higher. Harry allowed himself one proud smile, internally thanking Percy for his patience when teaching him. “Mr. Potter’s done it!” said Professor Flitwick, clapping excitedly, “Excellent use of both  Aguamenti  and  Wingardium Leviosa , Mr. Potter. Twenty points to Slytherin!” “You’re doing it  wrong  ,” Hermione, down at the next table, told Ron impatiently. “It’s Win-  gar  -dium Levi-  o  -sa. Not Wingardium Levio-  sar .” “You do it then, if you’re so clever!” snapped Ron, an eyebrow twitching. He was getting frustrated about  not getting the spell, and the Slytherin girl’s criticising tone wasn’t exactly helping. Hermione narrowed her eyes at the redhead, rolling up her sleeves. “ Wingardium Leviosa .” With a slight twitch of her wand, the feather levitated into the ceiling, little by little, floating happily, serenely, like a boat on the surface of a lake. “Very well done!” said Professor Flitwick, popping out of nowhere, “Ms. Granger’s done it as well! Fifteen points to Slytherin!” The professor then moved on, giving points to Daphne, Theodore, Blaise, Draco, and Tracey, each of which accomplished the spell, in that order. With each passing moment, the Gryffindors became more angsty— this didn’t go on for long, however. “You need to be firm with it,” suggested Daphne breezily to her partner, Lavender Brown. “Imagine the feather floating in your head, then say it like you mean it.” Lavender looked skeptical but did as Daphne told. She closed her eyes, picturing the floating feather and Professor Flitwick’s cheer of ‘Fifteen points to Gryffindor!’. When she opened her eyes once more, she uttered, strongly: “ Wingardium Leviosa !”. Much to her surprise, the feather started levitating, going higher and higher with each gentle twitch of her wand. “Nice,” said Daphne, clapping softly. On Daphne’s left, Theodore was doing the same with a nervous Neville. “Keep your voice steady,” instructed Theodore, who was making his feather dance in the air absent-mindedly. “Try not to let your wand shake. If it helps, put your elbow on the table to keep your hand steady.” Neville, who didn’t look very assured, placed his hand on the table and tried again, to no avail. “Hmm.” Theodore raised an eyebrow, letting his feather fall. Reaching over, he gripped Neville’s wand hand, before saying: “Say the incantation.” “ Wingardium L-Leviosa !” said Neville, his eyes widening into the size of teacups as the feather, guided with Theodore’s help, floated into the air. “W-Whoa. I-I did it!” “Yes, you did.” replied Theodore, amused. He let go of Neville’s hand, picking up his own wand to spin it between his fingers. “Try again. Imagine that I’m holding onto your wrist, just like I did just now.” Nervously, Neville pointed his wand at his feather again, trying to recall how the spell had felt with Theodore’s sleek fingers around his wrist. With that in mind, he stared at the feather, tugging on the warm feeling in his chest. “ Wingardium Leviosa !” “Fifteen points to Ms. Brown and Mr. Longbottom! Very well done.” cheered Professor Flitwick merrily, spotting their respective feathers from his perch on the desk at the front of class. Meanwhile, Ron was still scowling, his head turned away from the triumphant muggleborn. “Show off,” he snarled, “Bet you had no muggle friends—  no one wants to be friends with a show off.” Ron must’ve struck a nerve, because Hermione turned very, very still, turning rather white all over the sudden. Her lip began trembling; her fists were clenched. Hermione’s eyes turned glassy, and as if ashamed to look anyone in the eye, she tucked her face away, hidden by a curtain of her dark curls. As quickly as possible, the muggleborn stuffed her things into her bag, which was rather uncharacteristic of her, dashing out of the room without so much a word to the confused professor. Harry, who was watching the conversation unfold, got up instantly, wanting to follow after Hermione. “Nope,” intervened Draco, who was at the table beside Harry with a very awkward-looking Dean. “Trust me, Harry, you  don’t want to go after women when they’re upset. I say this from personal experience.” “I saw Hermione reading a book on hexes a few days ago,” added Theodore from the back absent-mindedly, making his feather twirl around in the air. Harry contemplated this for a few moments, and reluctantly, agreed not to go after Hermione. Once he was calm, however, his mind alerted him of his next priority, and the Boy-Who-Lived turned his fiercest glare onto one uncomfortable-looking Ron Weasley. “We should probably hold him back before he murders someone.” commented Daphne breezily. Thanks to Crabbe and Goyle’s combined effort, Ron  wasn’t  attacked by a very angry, four feet snake. When Hermione didn’t show up for lunch, Harry had half a mind to stomp over to the lion’s table and cast every spell he knew, even if the one that would probably do the most damage was a very,  very  strong  aguamenti , although he didn’t know how Percy would feel about him using a spell he taught on the prefect’s younger brother. “No,” said Daphne firmly, “If you attack him in the Great Hall, you’ll get points deducted. You don’t want that, do you?” Begrudgingly, Harry sat back down. As the day passed, Hermione continued to be absent for classes. While walking past a pair of first-year Gryffindors, he overheard a girl whispering to the other, “ Granger’s been crying in the bathroom for about a couple hours now… Guess Slytherins aren’t as stoic and cold as they appear to be .” Sighing internally, the boy swore to himself— if Hermione didn’t show up by four, he was going to go get her, even at the risk of being hexed into oblivion. Unfortunately, this promise slipped by his mind as three fifteen arrived, and Harry headed out to the Quidditch pitch, Nimbus Two Thousand safely in hand. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Since there was already one first-year player on the team, Terrence saw no problem with adding one more, which was how a very talented chaser by the name of Tracey Davis soared through the tryouts, earning herself a solid placing amongst her older teammates. Harry was incredibly relieved by this— he had a feeling that a few of the older players didn’t really  like him, and having Tracey, a familiar face his age, did help make things a little better.Aside from Tracey, a third-year student by the name of Damian Evereach made it onto the team as a reserve chaser, and he was  not very happy about being kept on the back burner while a first-year took the spotlight out on the pitch. Damian didn’t have any qualms about keeping his displeasure quiet, either. “She’s just a first-year!” Damian argued, face flushing a deep red and gripping his broomstick so hard Harry thought it might break. “And— And she’s a  girl ! One bludger comes at her and she’ll be screaming her pretty little head off!” “Excuse me?” Tracey, who was not one to stand by while she was being blatantly insulted, narrowed her eyes. “Why don’t,” interrupted Terrence smoothly. The seventh-year had been the captain of the Quidditch team for two years before he resigned due to receiving the position of Slytherin head boy. “We have a little competition? The winner gets to keep the starting position, loser takes reserve, no arguments.” The third-year boy glowered at Tracey, who returned with an equally fierce glare. “Sure. Not like it’s going to be much of a challenge,” snorted Damian, turning his nose away from the younger girl. “Alright!” Terrence clapped his hands cheerfully. “Here’s the rules. Both of you get five minutes to score as many times as possible, with Miles playing as keeper. The one that scores more gets to be on the starting line-up. Pretty simple, right? Which one of you would like to start first?” “I’ll go,” said Tracey before Damian could get a word in. From across the pitch, Miles Bletchley, the fifth-year Slytherin keeper, scoffed at her. Harry, who had already spent a few practices with the older player, was well-aware that people like him and Tracey— halfbloods, in other words— weren’t Miles’s favorite people. While Harry didn’t want to accuse someone before anything happened, he did think it was possible Miles would play harder against Tracey than Damian, just so that the halfblood girl wouldn’t get onto the starting line-up. Terrence smiled, as if all was right in the world and he couldn’t sense the bubbling tension between his players. By experience, Harry knew that Tracey could be rather sensitive about blood prejudices, if the way she snapped at him during the Sorting was any indication. “Then it’s settled,” the seeker said happily, “Marcus, Harry, Adrian, can you three come with to make sure it’s a fair competition?” Without prolonging any more, the mentioned players mounted their brooms and soared towards one of the goalposts, where Miles was already waiting, a sneer on his lips. Tracey didn’t look the least intimidated, her grip and posture relaxed as she hovered in the sky, waiting for Terrence to throw the Quaffle into the air. There were still a few students, lingering around even after they were eliminated through the first few rounds of the tryouts, watching in interest as the little competition unfolded. Terrence blew a whistle and threw the Quaffle into the air, and without a second to waste, Tracey swooped towards it and snatched it before anyone even blinked. Miles, who was caught off guard by the first-year chaser’s speed, didn’t have enough time to react as Tracey flew past the goal in a curve, shooting her first goal to the left of the keeper. A smirk danced across the girl’s lips as she took in Miles’s gaped jaw, Terrence blowing a whistle somewhere behind her. “Nice!” cheered Harry, giving Tracey a thumbs up as she flew past. “Woah, she’s good.” Adrian Pucey, one of the two beaters, muttered as he hovered beside Harry. The older boy was one of the players who  didn’t hate Harry, and although things were a little awkward between them at first, the tension eventually dissolved. While Harry wouldn’t call them friends, he could say that they were teammates, and that was better than nothing. To Miles Bletchley’s growing frustration, Tracey scored goal after goal, only getting two or three blocked by the keeper. When at last Terrence clicked the stopwatch, Marcus, Adrian, and Harry had counted nineteen goals each. “Not bad, kid,” Marcus nodded approvingly as Tracey joined them by the sidelines. Down at the centre of the court, Damian Evereach was scowling, thinking of ways to overthrow the first-year girl’s score, which wasn’t going to be easy. Nineteen goals in three hundred seconds was one goal every fifteen seconds— an impressive feat. The Slytherin girl’s flying style was very compact and efficient, using momentum to its full potential without letting it slow her down. “Thanks.” Things were looking pretty good for Tracey, who was grinning from ear-to-ear. Down at the pitch, Terrence blew the whistle and tossed the Quaffle into the air. Damian wasn’t too bad himself— after all, out of the thirty-or-so Slytherins who had shown up for the tryout (Draco wasn’t one of them), he managed to pull through all the way to the end. As he zoomed towards the court, the chaser stretched his arm backwards, pulling his broom into a sharp swerve just as he threw the Quaffle. It soared, like a rocket, right through the middle goal— Marcus narrowed his eyes at the keeper. With years of experience as a chaser on his back, he knew that Damian’s throw was good— but it hadn’t been good enough to get past Miles that easily. It hadn’t been very obvious, but the captain had a feeling that Miles had ducked out of the way to let the ball pass.  Just as he was about to reprimand the keeper, someone beat Marcus to it. “Hey!” yelled Damian, eyebrows knitted together angrily. “What was that?” “... That was unexpected.” said Adrian, blinking as he watched the situation unfold. “Look, I don’t need you giving me an easy pass,” growled Damian, hovering closer to Miles now. The keeper was glaring at the younger Slytherin, irritated at being called out by the person he was trying to help. “I’m going to beat her fair and square, because I don’t need to  cheat to win against a girl.” Terrence, who had flown up in case the argument needed de-escalating, hummed approvingly at the third-year’s behavior. “Let’s take that from the start, shall we?” At the end, Damian only scored eleven goals, eight short of Tracey. To his credit, he admitted defeat without making too much of a fuss. Even if he had lost the starting position, his outburst had gained him a good amount of respect from the team, save for Miles, who was still fuming angrily. “Now,” Terrence said, smiling once again like all was right in the world, “Why don’t the two of you shake hands? You’re going to be on the same team, and eventually you’re going to have to play together.” The captain raised his eyebrows at this, but did nothing to overwrite Terrence’s words. The starting chaser and the reserve chaser stared at each other, unmoving. Distrust was held in Tracey’s eyes like a sharp polearm. “Better not slack off on the training, Davis,” said Damian at last, extending his hand and making the first move begrudgingly. “I won’t give up on an opportunity to overtake you.” “Noted.” Tracey reached out and took the older boy’s hand, willing to call a truce if the other was. “However, I can assure you that I won’t slip up.” The third-year smirked, but it faded into a more sheepish expression. “... About what I said… About you being a girl… I shouldn’t have said that. I was just… Really irritated about losing the position to a first year, but… You deserve the spot more than I do.” Unexpectedly, Tracey smiled and punched her upperclassman playfully on the shoulder. “Apology accepted.” Terrence smiled widely like a proud mama bird, puffing up his chest and beaming at his new teammates like he wanted to pull them into a big hug and squish their cheeks. Harry didn’t think either Tracey or Damian would like that very much, but at the same time, he didn’t think the seeker would let that stop him. On the other hand, standing on Terrence’s left, Marcus looked as if he was going to throw up his breakfast just by being in proximity to the apology unfolding before them. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────It was only as he walked up to the Great Hall for the Halloween Feast that Harry remembered the muggleborn. Feeling guilty, he glanced around the space wildly, hoping that he would find a bush of curly hair. Draco noticed this and surprisingly, helped Harry look. They searched all through the Slytherin table, but Hermione was nowhere in sight. “Maybe she needs a bit more space,” Draco offered helpfully, “Mother always retreats to the library for the whole day when she’s upset. Father knows better than to approach her while she’s in there.” The Halloween decorations were spectacular, although Harry wasn’t really in the mood to admire them. Magically-cast clouds were hanging low in the hall, taking the place of the floating candles. Among the clouds swooped a thousand live bats, screeching occasionally as the students found their seats. Up at the head table, Dumbledore smiled and kept the greetings to a short, clapping his hands and letting Hogwarts dig into the numerous pumpkin delicacies that appeared on golden plates. “You should eat something, Harry,” suggested Daphne when she noticed the boy pushing his food around gloomily. Before Harry could reply, Professor Quirrell burst into the Great Hall, turban askew and looking mad. His eyes were blown wide in panic, and if Harry was being honest, the man looked rather maniacal. Everyone watched, staring, as Professor Quirrell stumbled his way before the Headmaster, gasping in the aftereffects of terror. “Troll— troll in the dungeons— thought you ought to know,.” said the defense professor before collapsing onto a pile on the floor. An uproar exploded in the Great Hall. Students were yelling left and right— how did a troll get in the school— didn’t Hogwarts have magic wards that prevented that kind of thing— what were they going to do—“Silence!” demanded the Headmaster, silencing the hall with a few loud sparks from his wand. “Prefects, lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately!” The other three houses scurried into action instantly, leaving the Slytherin table staring at the Headmaster like he was the greatest doofus they’d ever met. For Merlin’s sake, their dormitories were in the dungeons— where the troll was— did Dumbledore hate them so much that he wanted to send them walking into the arms of a troll? “For Circe’s sake,” snapped Professor Snape irritatedly, “Slytherin prefects, lead your house to the library. Stay there until further notice from me.” All along the Slytherin table, the prefects snapped into duty. Terrence marched quickly towards the front of the table, where the younger years were clumped. In the face of danger, the head prefect kept a calm demeanor, commanding his fellow prefects into order. “Gemma, Caden, group the first years and do a headcount! Arowelle, settle the second years. Marcus, help Peregrine with the third year. The rest of the years, make sure your yearmates are present!”Without any further delay, Terrence took up the lead, stringing along the whole Slytherin house towards the library. “Draco,” whispered Harry suddenly as they were ascending a staircase. “I just thought— Hermione.” It took the blonde boy a moment to realise what the other was talking about. “... No.”“She doesn’t know about the troll,” said Harry desperately. “I heard some of the Gryffindors saying that she’s crying in one of the first-floor toilets.” Draco breathed heavily, glancing around. “Alright, fine,” he conceded, “But we better not let the prefects see us.” As sneakily as they could, the two boys slowly slinked out from their group, hanging back further and further. Gemma was leading the front of the group while Caden was bringing up the back, which made it rather difficult to slip away. Just as luck would have it, a group of first-year Gryffindors jostled into their path, igniting a bunch of noise and the perfect opportunity to get away. “Let’s go,” Harry whispered, taking advantage of the situation to slip away. Caden was behind them, snarling at the pushing Gryffindors to have some order, for Merlin’s sake. However, even if they weren’t noticed by Caden, they were seen by another prefect. A prefect named Percy Weasley, who, after a moment’s consideration, left Oliver in charge and went running after the two snakes. It didn’t take Percy long to catch up to them, scaring the two boys out of their skins when he approached them from the back. “What are you two doing?” said Percy, eyes narrowed and with the sternest voice he could do. “We…” Harry glanced at Draco unsurely. “... Well, earlier today, Hermione got upset and ran off and we haven’t seen her for the whole day. I heard some girls saying that she was crying in one of the first-floor toilets, and we… We were thinking that Hermione doesn’t know about the troll, so we’re going to get her.” The Gryffindor prefect sighed, deducing in his head that the two were, more-or-less, right in going to search for their friend. He remembered the muggleborn girl— she had been the one with Harry when the boy stood in front of the Fat Lady’s portrait, looking for Ron. “You should’ve let one of your prefects know,” he reprimanded, looking behind him. The Slytherin group was long gone, and it would take too much time to collect a prefect from the snakes. “... Alright, let's make this fast. I’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower soon.” They hadn’t gone far when Percy suddenly heard footsteps, his heart thrumming in warning. “Shoot,” hissed Percy, pulling the two first years behind a stone griffin. He thought he was going to have a heart attack when Snape swooshed past them on a warpath, too focused on his destination to notice the three stray students. “Merlin, that was close. Let’s hurry before any other teacher comes along.” They scurried along the deserted corridors towards the bathroom, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for any other professor. Snape’s footsteps had faded away sometime ago, but there was a different danger now— a danger that smelt like foul, rotten cabbages. “Hey… Do you smell that?” Draco asked, scrunching his nose up in disgust. “Oh Circe, no,” Percy whispered. It took a moment longer for it to click for the two first years, but as soon they realised, they turned as white as Percy was. Soon enough, the echoes of heavy footsteps— footsteps that definitely  didn’t belong to Snape— started reverberating down the corridor. Just as the blonde opened his mouth to scream, Percy clamped his hand over Draco’s face, trying his very best not to run in fear. It emerged over the corner— a twelve foot tall atrocity with sick-looking green skin, uneven nostrils and thick, bluish lips. The troll had a body like a giant boulder, with his comparatively small head stuck on the top like a bald coconut. Dragging behind the great thing was a club with branch-sized spikes, oozing some kind of green mucus. Harry was too stricken in fear to even open his mouth. The troll stumbled slowly, stupidly, towards a doorway by the statue that the three were hiding behind. Sniffing it tentatively, the great thing smiled sluggishly, his mouth opened lopsidedly. The whole floor shook as the troll stepped into the room, grunting happily. “The key’s in the lock,” said Harry, shaking slightly. “We… We could lock it inside.” Percy gulped. “Alright. You two stay right here.  Do not go anywhere else, you hear me?” Both of the snakes nodded— they wouldn’t dare go anywhere close to the doorway, even if they were forced to. They peered over the corner of the statue as Percy crept towards the doorway, lifting his wand so that the door creaked, terrifyingly slowly, close. As soon as the door clicked into the frame, Percy reached out, locking the door and jerking away so quickly that it looked like the key was white-hot. Letting out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, Percy turned back towards the two snakes, who gave him thumbs-ups. Before he could say anything however, a piercing, screeching scream came from inside the door. Horrified, all three of them flicked their gazes towards the door at the same time, uttering the same word in unison: “ Hermione !” With no other choice, Percy unlocked the door, bursting in even though everything he knew was telling him to run the other way. The twelve-foot troll turned to look at him, smiling stupidly at the sight of quadrupled dinner. Shivering behind a half-smashed toilet stall was Hermione, tear tracks down her cheeks. “You two, get her out of here!” yelled Percy, who somehow managed to stand his ground even though his instincts told him to run like his life depended on it (it probably did). The Slytherins didn’t waste a single second, going towards Hermione. Harry clasped his hand on her wrist, trying to pull her up, but the muggleborn wouldn’t budge, frozen in shock. “Come on, Hermione!” said Harry desperately as Percy, behind them, yelled: “ Petrificus totalus !” Draco looked behind them to see Percy’s spell bounce off the troll’s thick skin harmlessly. As seconds passed, the prefect looked more and more desperate, pulling on every spell he could remember. “Hurry!” yelled Percy, doing his best not to trip over the debris as he continued firing at the troll, going on auto-pilot now. “Come  on , Granger!” said Draco, joining in, tugging on the girl as hard as he could. “I can’t die! I’m the only Malfoy heir!” Just as they were talking, Percy had run out of spells to try. The troll lumbered towards him angrily, cornering him, not amused by all the flashing lights the prefect had produced. Percy squeezed his eyes shut, hoping and praying that the first years would have enough time to get out—“ AGUAMENTI  !” yelled Harry, whipping his wand. Water burst out from every tap in the bathroom, spraying the troll with geysers everywhere he looked, giving Percy time to get to his senses and move. “Draco,  help !” “ HOW ?” shrieked the pureblood. “I DON’T KNOW, JUST DO  SOMETHING !” “UM—  WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA  !” yelled Draco, off the top of his mind. He pointed his wand at the troll’s club, sweating under the effort to keep it afloat. Behind him, Hermione managed to get onto her feet. She stumbled towards him, shaking as she clasped Draco’s wand hand with hers. Together, the both of them lifted the club to the troll’s height. The two made eye contact, and synchronised with each other, they pulled back and  swung , smacking the distracted troll with his own club. Howling in pain, the troll clutched at his head. Harry took this chance to redirect  all the water at the troll, while Draco and Hermione moved as one again, going at the troll with a second swing. This did the trick— with an awful moan, the troll swayed, left, right, left… And collapsed onto the ground, sending a wave of dust into the air. Percy, who had now caught his breath, was staring at the three first years in astonishment. It then occurred to him that they had made a ruckus, and should probably leave before the teachers descended onto the scene—Too late. Professor McGonagall burst into the room, closely followed by a panicked Professor Snape and Professor Quirrell who brought up the rear. The defense professor took one look at the knocked-out troll, gasped, and fell over a toilet bowl, clutching at his heart weakly. “ What  , were you  thinking  ?” thundered Professor Snape, stomping over to his three snakes. Hermione hurriedly unclasped her hand from Draco’s, all three looking as guilty as possible. “No, were you even thinking  at all ?” Even as he berated them, the Head of Slytherin was looking over his snakes, making them lift their arms to check for injuries. When at last he was sure that none of them had sustained anything serious, besides the little cuts on their faces and hands from the tiny shards of ceramic that were sent flying when the troll fell, he let out a relieved breath. “Mr. Weasley, could you please inform us on what happened?” said Professor McGonagall, eyeing Quirrell like he was a piece of stale meat. The Gryffindor prefect risked a quick glance at the three snakes before opening his mouth. “... According to Malfoy and Harry, a student made Granger rather upset during class today. She came to the bathroom to… Er… Settle her emotions. On their way to the library, they realised that Granger didn’t know about the troll, as she didn’t show up for the feast, so they… Informed a prefect, me, and came to bring her back to the library.” Both Draco and Harry tried their very best to look as if they had gotten Percy right from the start, instead of the prefect coming after them of his own accord. “If I may say so, Professor,” Percy continued, “Both Harry and Malfoy displayed house unity by thinking of and coming after their housemate. In addition… When the troll cornered me, Harry used a powerful  aguamenti on the troll while Malfoy and Granger levitated the club together and knocked it out.” The potions professor, still fuming at the three Slytherins, snarled at them. “Five points off  each of you for idiocy.” “If I may add to that, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall, looking innocent. “Twenty points to  each of you for bravery, house unity, and sheer dumb luck. Many adults don’t have the courage to stand up to a full grown mountain troll, but the four of you did it. On top of that, you knocked it out, too.”Professor Snape looked like he wanted to argue, but thought the better of it. Instead, he grumbled under his breath, looking significantly less angry now. “Come. In case you three spontaneously decide to put yourself in life-threatening danger  again  , I’ll personally  escort you down to the dorms. Quirinus… You’ll be able to handle this yourself, since it’s already passed out?” “Y-Y-Yes, S-Severus,” stammered Professor Quirrell, who had finally found his footing. “Mr. Weasley,” drawled the potions professor, “If you’d  be so kind as to stop by the library before returning to the tower, please inform the other Slytherins that they may return to their dorms.” “Yes, Professor,” said Percy, his skin looking more of a natural colour now. The Head of Slytherin gestured for his three snakes to leave the bathroom, and just before he walked out after them, he paused. “Ten points to Gryffindor for inter-house unity.” With a dramatic  swish of his robes, Professor Snape left, leaving an amused Professor McGonagall and a shocked Percy in his wake. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Winter had reinforced its hold on Hogwarts for the year, covering every surface in sight with a thick, white blanket. The stone corridors leading down to the dorms were unbearable to walk in, even with the heating charms Terrence helped lace into their robes. Draco’s clothing came with built-in charms, but Hermione’s didn’t. The head prefect was kind enough to help infuse the hems of the muggleborn’s clothes with the same charms he sewed into Harry’s. 

Even then, the castle was freezing. Harry, Hermione, and Draco, who had become closer than ever since the troll incident, had taken to going everywhere 

together

, clumping close to each other like baby penguins in order to preserve body heat. Apparently, at Hermione’s old school, she hadn’t had many friends, for everyone hated how she was a know-it-all that scored top in 

everything

. When she arrived at Hogwarts, the muggleborn did her very best to suppress her intelligence (not that she was very successful at doing so) in fear that she would be all alone again. 

The situation escalated when Harry and Hermione both sighed mournfully about their lack of friends— perhaps with the exception of each other. This resulted in Draco giving them appalled looks. 

“No friends?” scoffed the blonde, crossing his arms. The three were seated together by the common room fireplace, their potions textbooks open on their laps. “What am I then, invisible?” 

His words did not quite have the effect he had intended, because next thing Draco knew, both Hermione and Harry were staring at him as if he had just solved world poverty. 

“We’re friends?” said Harry tearily, his eyes big.


That 

was how Draco spent the next half-an-hour explaining to his two very emotional housemates that 

yes

, they were 

friends

, and 

Granger

, I wouldn’t have gone into a bathroom with a troll had you not been my friend. The pureblood was honestly exasperated with the two muggle-raised snakes by the end of their conversation, but could you really blame them? Neither of the two had a good basis for the definition of a friend, as Harry was isolated from his schoolmates because of Dudley— and Hermione was never quite liked by hers. 

Right after the troll fiasco came Quidditch season, which riled the whole school up a plenty. Draco, unsurprisingly, was the most excited among the Slytherin first-years, even though he sulked for a whole night after finding out that Tracey had made the team, too. Theodore, on the other hand, simply couldn’t be bothered. The boy would much rather spend his entire day indoors, doing research, rather than head out to the pitch and get bombarded with whatever weather it was that day, be it sunny, rainy, or windy. 

Saturday would be Harry’s first ever match: Slytherin vs. Gryffindor. If Slytherin won, they would move up to second place in the house championships, and if they won another match against Hufflepuff, Slytherin would take the House Cup for the eighth year in a row.

Marcus had been relentless in his trainings, slotting them in whenever possible. Oliver, who was also determined to get in as many practice sessions as he could, was constantly passive-aggressively fighting the Slytherin captain for the time slots. As of the moment, there hadn’t been an intervention needed by Terrence yet, as the two captains had resorted to being overly kind to each other as a method of… Well, competing. It was one of the oddest phenomenons Hogwarts had ever seen. 

“Have a great day, Wood!” called out Marcus one day a few weeks ago, with a smile too wide to be genuine. 

The Gryffindor did not fail to return the wish. “You too, Flint!” said Oliver, smiling equally widely. “Hope you get full marks on that Charms test!” 

Between Marcus’s hard-won training slots and Terrence’s close monitoring of Harry’s diet (the older seeker would stalk over to the younger’s seat at the Great Hall, plop a bunch of proteins and greens on to his plate, give him a look that said ‘eat up or else’ before stalking back over to where the seventh years sat), the emerald-eyed boy gained good weight, his skin having a much healthier glow as compared to when the school year first started. 

On the weekend before the match, the seeker escorted Harry to the infirmary, where Madam Pomfrey inspected the reserve for a couple minutes before declaring him healthy enough to play. Unbeknownst to Harry, once he and Terrence left the bay, Professor Snape flooed in, raising his eyebrows at Hogwarts mediwitch. 

“That Terrence sure is a miracle worker,” said Madam Pomfrey happily, showing the potions professor the chart she was holding. “Harry’s weight has gone up! The boy doesn’t look that malnourished anymore— who knows, give it a few months and he might start sprouting! Merlin knows that boy’s too small for his age.” 

Nodding approvingly, the Head of Slytherin made a mental note to give Terrence his thanks. On the night of Harry’s first practice, Terrence had discussed the possibility of Harry most likely being malnourished, due to his small stature, as compared to his yearmates. Using the excuse of Quidditch, both the captain and the seeker did their best to boost Harry’s health, ensuring that he got the right nutrients and following it up with sufficient exercise. 

Since Madam Pomfrey had given him the green light, Terrence happily announced to the younger boy: “I’ve decided that you’ll be playing as seeker in our Gryffindor match.” 

Harry nearly tripped onto his face. “I’m sorry?” he stuttered. Initially, he thought that Terrence would be playing— since the older had more experience. On top of that, it was his last year at Hogwarts— wouldn’t he want to get in as many games as he could before graduating? 

“Both Marcus and I think you’re ready,” reasoned Terrence thoughtfully. “Plus, you’re much faster than I am. Wood saw you during your first practice— but you’ve improved loads since then, they won’t be prepared to take you on. On the other hand, Gryffindor’s played plenty against me, and it’s not like I’ve made a large step on my skills.” 

“B-But it’s your last year,” Harry protested. 

The older seeker rolled his eyes. “I’ve played a 

ton 

of games in my years here, Harry. Been on the team since second year, got on the starting in my third.” Terrence stopped in his tracks, looking Harry in the eyes confidently. “Look. I wouldn’t ask you to play if I didn’t think you’re ready— but you 

are

. Even Marcus agrees. Think of it this way— if mid-game, you really think you can’t handle it, I’ll sub in for you, alright?” 

Unable to argue anymore with the older seeker, Harry reluctantly agreed. If he was being honest, he was utterly 

terrified

— of letting Terrence down, of letting his whole team down, of letting his whole 

house 

down. If they lost the game against Gryffindor, there was no way they’d be able to make their way up to first place by the end of the season, not unless Gryffindor utterly butchered their next match. 

At the same time, though, Harry couldn’t deny— he was 

excited

. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Harry was really, 

really 

grateful that he had a genius for a friend. The day before the match, he, Hermione and Draco were out in the courtyard during break. Hermione, bless her, had taught herself how to conjure 

blue fire

, and had contained it in a jam jar so that they could carry it around easily. The three snakes huddled around the glass, sighing happily at the warmth it provided. 

All of a sudden, a great black figure appeared across the courtyard, striding— limping— over. It was Professor Snape, and he must’ve noticed the guilty expressions they were wearing as they all moved to hide the jam jar. However, the Head of Slytherin was no fool. He raised his eyebrow, gesturing for them to move apart. Guiltily, they did so, revealing Hermione with the jar in her hands. 

As Professor Snape opened his mouth to speak, Harry interrupted him. “Hermione wasn’t trying to break any rules, professor, she was just—” 

“

If

 you’d let me get in a word before getting defensive, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Snape, drawling slightly. Even Draco, who had boasted often about the potions professor being his godfather, was shrinking back nervously. “I was about to award Ms. Granger two points for excellent spell-casting.” 

All three first-years blinked at the professor in unison, not having expected that from the man. 

If the professor noticed their looks, he ignored it. “Play a good game tomorrow, Mr. Potter.” 

“I-I’ll try, sir,” said Harry, feeling awkward for accusing the professor out of nowhere— especially with the way the man looked after them after the troll incident. Instead of shepherding them back to the commons, like he said he would, Professor Snape led them down a separate way to his office. 

Right by the office door was a dropoff box, with a slit at the top for students (mainly Hermione) to drop their questions. Professor Snape nudged them in gently, closing the door behind them with a flick of a finger. 

“Sit,” said the professor, waving his hand carelessly. The three Slytherins shuffled over to a couch by the side of the dark-themed room, looking at the oak bookshelves and the large, black table that sat in the middle of the room atop a deep green rug. The potions master disappeared into one of the storage rooms connected to his office, returning a few minutes later with some balms in hand. “Now, are the three of you responsible enough to apply this yourself, or do I have to help?” 

Both Harry and Hermione took the balm themselves, using the mirror the professor conjured in order to dab at their injuries. Draco, on the other hand, preened and waited for his godfather to tend to his cuts. That didn’t mean the Head of Slytherin neglected the other two, however— his gaze would flick to the muggle-raised snakes every once a while, making sure they were still doing fine. 

“Mr. Potter,” said the professor all of a sudden, startling the said boy, “... Do you think the amount you’ve applied is sufficient?” 

Flushing slightly, Harry tucked his head down in embarrassment. “I… I don’t know, sir.” 

Professor Snape sighed tiredly, taking the jar of ointment from the young halfblood. “Watch and learn, Mr. Potter. I have no shortage of healing balms. There is no need for you to use so little. Do you understand?”

“Y-Yes, sir,” replied Harry shyly, trying not to flinch away when the professor dabbed at his wounds gently. 

“Can you do it yourself now?” Professor Snape asked, meeting the emerald eyes that belonged to someone he loved with his entire existence. When he initially noticed how little Harry was using on his wounds, it occurred to him that the boy’s relatives might’ve never given him a proper teaching on how to care for his own injuries— worse, they never provided him with the supplies for the child to tend to himself. 

That was a terrifying thought. 

Harry, oblivious to all the inner turmoil he was putting his professor through, dabbed at his wounds, using a more generous amount of the balm than he had previously. Something about the professor’s words made his chest warm, but it was a little strange… How had the professor known that Harry was worried about using too much? 

The morning of the match came much too quickly for Harry’s liking. It felt like he had barely just fallen asleep, tossing and turning all night under his covers. He felt restless, and it was as if every nerve cell in his brain had gone haywire. Theodore was only a moment away from force-feeding the green-eyed boy some calming draught, but Blaise reasoned that it might have aftereffects on his nervous system, such as causing him to be drowsy during the match (which no one wanted). 

“You’ve got to eat something, Harry,” advised Daphne, Hermione nodding worriedly in agreement. 

“I don’t think I have an appetite,” said the young seeker. He felt a little green in the face— what would the team say if he got sick right before the match? 

Merlin

— would they call him a coward for backing out? What would the other houses think? He would’ve disgraced his entire house, no, he couldn’t get sick—

“I can already hear Harry spiralling off into panic,” commented Theodore dryly, stabbing a piece of sausage. 

“Get a grip, Harry,” said Tracey, who looked completely relaxed, despite it being her first game as well. “The match hasn’t even started. Also, if I were you, I’d eat something before Higgs comes over and forces food down your throat.” 

By eleven, the entire school had crowded into the stands, jostling over each other for a proper seat. Harry, who could hear the noise from the locker rooms, was pale in fright. The entire team had gotten dressed in their green Quidditch robes, complete with black pads over their arms, shoulders, and knees. 

“Listen up!” yelled Marcus, silencing the whole team instantly. “This is our first match. We’ve already been through the strategy, if any one of you forgets,” he glared at them, daring anyone to raise their hand and say that they forgot, “There will be hell to pay.” 

“He means, you’ll have to scrub Professor Snape’s cauldrons for three weeks,” provided Terrence helpfully. 

Honestly, Harry thought it would be impossible to forget Marcus’s strategy. The captain had essentially drilled it into their heads, having repeated it a million times. The dark-haired boy was sure that if he pressed some sort of button in his brain, a playback of Marcus’s voice would start reciting the plan, top to bottom. 

“We’ve got two new players,” continued Marcus. At that point, Terrence’s random interventions had become normal for the captain. “Gryffindor won’t know what hit them. We’re going to take the win, and we’re going to take it 

fast

. Do whatever it takes to win. Got it?” 

“Do try not to get any penalties, though.” added Terrence cheerfully. 

Outside, the crowd was cheering louder and louder, hooting and clapping, whistling and screaming, all mashed up into one clamouring orchestra. Harry felt a stone drop into his stomach, and could do nothing more than pray that his legs wouldn’t give out under him. 

“I think it’s time,” Terrence said finally, “Do your best, everyone!” 

It was actually happening. Harry swallowed thickly, wishing he had half of Tracey’s confidence. The girl didn’t even look bothered by the crowd, glancing around uninterestedly. Behind him, Peregrine and Adrian were absent-mindedly talking about the dates of their upcoming tests. 

“Now,” said Madam Hooch, who was standing in the middle of the field as the two teams approached each other. Harry couldn’t help but glare at her darkly, causing him to get questioning looks from the rest of his teammates. “I want a fair game from all of you.” This remark seemed to be directed to Marcus, who shrugged innocently. 

As soon as the whistle blew, Harry soared up into the sky, following Marcus’s instructions on staying out of the way until he found the snitch. Across the sky, he spotted Gryffindor’s seeker— Natalie Williams, a second-year. From the suspicious expression she was wearing, she’d seen him, too. Deciding to avoid any confrontations, Harry tugged his broomstick away, too preoccupied with nerves to enjoy the warmer winter day. 

Down at the stands, Draco was peering at the sky with his binoculars, doused in anxiety. 

“— 

And the Quaffle is immediately taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor

— 

great chaser

—

 attractive, too

—” Lee Jordan, a Gryffindor, was doing the commentary, Professor McGonagall behind him with her arms crossed. 

“You think they saw the banner?” asked Daphne absent-mindedly to Hermione, who was on her right. The first year Slytherins had prepared a surprise for their yearmates— a banner that read ‘Go Potter + Davis!’ with a depiction of a giant snake, brought to life by Theodore and Hermione’s combined genius. It’s tongue was flickering out every few seconds, a smart little trick the two managed to pull off. The Gryffindors on the opposite side of the stands were reeling back, some in fear and awe (Percy, who was impressed by the charm work).  

“Tracey seems to have seen it,” replied Hermione, who had binoculars of her own. Luckily, Draco had brought an extra pair. At the moment, the halfblood girl was zooming across the court, weaving in and out between the Gryffindor chasers as she passed the Quaffle back and forth between Marcus and Peregrine. “Harry… I’m not sure. He’s too high up.” 

“

Oof! First-year Slytherin chaser Tracey Davis has taken the Quaffle

— 

passes it to Marcus Flint, Slytherin captain

—

 Flint does an underpass to Derrick

—

 he shoots

— 

and Gryffindor keeper Oliver Wood blocks it!

” 

This roused a round of groans from the Slytherin stands while the red-decked students on the opposite side cheered and clapped. 

“Don’t mind, don’t mind!” yelled Peregrine, up in the sky, over the wind. Marcus looked slightly irritated, but Tracey was eerily calm, her face completely unfazed by all that was going on around her. 

“

And chaser Katie Bell gains the Quaffle

— 

neat pass to Angelina Johnson

— 

ooh, nice dive around Flint there

— 

she aims

— 

shoots

— 

Slytherin keeper Miles Bletchley goes for the Quaffle

— 

and he misses! GRYFFINDOR SCORES!

” 

Draco whined, slumping in his seat. Behind him, Theodore was reading one of Professor Snape’s books, a face of calm among all the ruckus. Blaise, who wasn’t 

that 

into Quidditch but was still sort-of invested— sighed defeatedly. 

“

Slytherin back in possession

— 

Marcus Flint soaring up there

— 

pass to Derrick

— 

he’s flying up there like an eagle, or should I say, a peregrine

— 

Gryffindor chaser Katie Bell snatches the Quaffle

— 

or not, Davis of Slytherin in possession

— 

Merlin, that girl is fast

— 

she shoots

— 

keeper Wood dives

— 

and Slytherin scores!

” 

Lee Jordan wasn’t able to keep the biasness out of his voice as he announced the goal, sounding a little dismayed. 

“Nice one, Davis!” whooped Draco from the stands. She must’ve heard him, for the girl made eye contact and did a mini salute to her fellow first years. The banner, levitated on one end by Daphne and on the other by a distracted Theodore, flapped livelily, making the chaser grin. 

“Move over.” 

The blonde nearly jumped out of his seat when Argus Filch seemingly appeared out of nowhere, looking very out of place among the Slytherin stands. All around him, the snakes were staring at him, some in horror and some in shock. It was unheard of for Mr. Filch to attend the games, but there he was. 

“Mr. Filch!” said Hermione brightly, moving so that there was space for the caretaker. “I didn’t know you’d come to see the game.” 

The old man opened his mouth and closed it again, looking both embarrassed and grumpy at the same time. “I’ve got to clean the stands after anyway. Might as well get here early.” 

While this was happening, Harry had completed a dozen or so laps around the pitch— until he spotted a flash of gold, but after a moment realised it was a reflection from one of the twin Weasley beater’s wristwatches. 

“

Slytherin chaser Derrick ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys

— 

what a pair

— 

heads for the goal

— 

hang on, was that the Snitch

?” 

At this, a murmur burst out across the stadium as everyone squinted as hard as they could, trying to catch a sight of the small walnut-sized ball. Peregrine, who had been distracted by the Weasleys, had missed the subtle 

bzz 

of the Snitch darting past his left ear. Harry, hearing the commentary, pulled his broomstick into a steep dive— one sharper than the one he had attempted during his first flying lesson. This caught the attention of the crowd. Even the chasers, beaters, and keepers stopped to watch Harry hurtle towards the ground at breakneck speed. 

Gryffindor seeker Natalie must’ve thought he saw the snitch, for she dived after him, pushing her broom faster to make up for the distance between them. She squinted as hard as she could, but she couldn’t see the Snitch that Harry seemed so fixated on. As everyone else was distracted, Marcus and Tracey managed a pass across the pitch in record time, scoring another for Slytherin. 

Just before he hit the ground, Harry pulled swiftly out of the dive, spiralling upwards beautifully as Natalie crashed and rolled over on the grass. Standing in the tower kept for reserves, Terrence was jumping up and down, beaming in pride and clapping like his own child had just won the World Cup. 

“

Was that… the Wronski Feint?

” Even though Slytherin had scored about two more goals now, Lee Jordan was captivated by the young first-year seeker, who looked back apologetically at his Gryffindor counterpart. After making sure Natalie wasn’t harmed too badly, Harry took back into the skies, knowing he didn’t have much time before the Gryffindor came after him again. He swore he had seen the Snitch in the corner of his sight just before he pulled from his dive— it couldn’t be that far away… 

“Harry performed a Wronski Feint!” Draco was fanning himself on the stands, moments away from a breakdown. 

“The Wronski Feint…?” Hermione furrowed her eyebrows, recalling. “Oh! That’s the move that’s famously used by… Victor Krum, right? The Bulgerian seeker?” 

Draco looked at Hermione like she was his savior, leaping up excitedly. “Thank 

Merlin 

at least 

someone 

knows their Quidditch. It’s a particularly dangerous seeker maneuver— and Harry just pulled it off—” 

“We get it, Draco, sit down before someone at the back smacks you,” said Daphne, tugging the blonde boy down. They turned back to the game, Draco and Hermione scouring the pitch with their binoculars as Daphne surveyed the whole game calmly. Harry seemed to have spotted the Snitch— he was zooming into the skies, eyes focused on a point— he reached a hand out, as if he were going to catch the Snitch— 

Harry yelped, feeling his broom lurch dangerously just as the Snitch was almost in his grasp. The sudden change in momentum pushed the boy backwards, and if he had been holding his broom any looser, he would’ve been thrown off, sent plummeting with more than sixty feet between him and the ground. 

Clutching onto the handle, Harry caught his breath, wrapping his knees around his broom tightly. The broom had never behaved like that before— why now, of all times? The Snitch was gone once more— and it had been so close, too… 

Before that line of thought could continue, Harry’s broom bucked again, as if it was actively trying to throw him off. Both Slytherin and Gryffindor players stopped to stare at him. The two Weasleys, who were the closest players to the boy, soared up to him, blocking a Bludger from flying into the panicked seeker’s face. 

“Hey, you alright there?” asked one of the twins, scrunching his eyebrows. They remembered him well— the shy boy on platform 9 ¾. Even they could tell that the movement of his broom was not natural, and coupled with the expression of pure fear on Harry’s face— something wasn’t right. 

“H-Help,” stammered Harry, clinging on for dear life as his broom rolled over and over, shaking the boy’s grip until he was only hanging onto his broom by one hand, not having enough strength to pull himself up. Below him, the crowd gasped and scrambled for their binoculars, trying to get a look at the boy. 

“Potter!” Peregrine had flown up to help, looking worried. Tracey wasn’t far behind, wide-eyed at the situation. 

“Don’t!” warned one of the twins. “The closer we get to him, the further his broom jerks away. We need to get him nearer to the ground.” 

Back upon the stands, Hermione was now searching through the crowd desperately, while Draco had his binoculars focused on Harry, the blonde’s breath hitching everytime the broom lurched. Theodore had set his book down now, squinting at the specks of red and green far up in the sky. 

“Hermione, what are you—” Daphne asked, staring at the muggleborn. Everyone had their eyes on Harry, and yet, the bushy-haired girl was searching through the stands, as if she were looking for—

“Found him!” Hermione hissed, handing the binoculars to a bewildered Daphne. “Keep your eyes on Professor Quirrell, 

do not 

let him out of your sight!” Mr. Filch, who was right beside the two, looked equally, if not more, bewildered. 

Without another word, the girl snatched her jam jar and dashed away, clambering under the yells of confused students, with only one motive in mind. Daphne, following Hermione’s orders, searched the stands for the defense professor, finding the man clutching his wand on his lap, staring without blinking up at the Slytherin seeker, muttering continuously… 

Adjusting the binoculars, Daphne tracked down a flurry of curly hair, spotting Hermione rushing under the crowds towards the teacher’s stands. Changing her focus again, the pureblood girl saw Professor Snape, holding his wand much more openly, muttering just like Quirrel was. 

“I can’t watch, I can’t watch this, Harry’s going to die—!” Draco was wailing, his binoculars now in Theodore’s hands. 

“Quiet, boy!” snapped Mr. Filch, who was worried enough as it was. 

Theodore had his gaze focused on Harry, who was still hanging on for dear life. The broom was still buckling, and slowly, slowly, slicked by sweat, Harry’s grip was slipping. The two Weasleys, Peregrine, Tracey, and Marcus were circling under the boy in hopes they could catch him when he fell, while the two Slytherin beaters— Lucian Bole and Adrian Pucey— were smacking away any Bludger that got too close. 

Racing under the stands, Hermione finally got into position under Quirrel, her blood boiling when she heard the words he was muttering. She was right— the defense professor was jinxing Harry’s broom, maintaining eye contact as he did so. Without remorse, she untightened her jam jar, letting her blue fire loose onto Quirrell’s robes. Hearing a sudden sound under the stands, Professor Snape snapped away from his counter jinx, eyes widening when he stared into the determined gaze of Hermione Granger, not a trace of guilt on her face as she blatantly set fire onto the other professor. 

Hermione didn’t say a word, and neither did Severus. It took Quirrell a moment to realise he was on fire— the man yelped, patting his robes desperately. Having done what she needed to do, Hermione gathered the fire back into the jar, knowing full well that her Head of House had caught her in the act. 

“Harry’s got back on his broom!” Theodore said suddenly. The broom had stopped lurching all of a sudden, and cautiously, Peregrine approached the boy, giving him a hand as the seeker pulled himself back onto the Nimbus. “Draco, you can open your eyes now.” 

“You set Quirrell on fire,” said Daphne casually, quietly, as Hermione returned to her seat. 

“I set Quirrell on fire,” said the muggleborn, shrugging. Beside them, Mr. Filch turned a deaf ear to the conversation beside him. If anyone asked him, his answer would be 

no

, Hermione Granger 

didn’t 

blatantly confess to committing arson on a professor. “What’s the score?” 

“Seventy-all.” 

Once Marcus made sure Harry was still able to play, the game resumed (not that it had been paused in the first place, everyone just stopped doing whatever they were doing). The boy was unsteady on his broom at first, eyeing it like he expected it to lurch again any moment. No more than five minutes later, he spotted the Snitch once more, and deciding to take a leap of faith, he pulled into a dive, going faster and faster. Natalie, who had seen it too, wasn’t far behind, the two seekers flying neck-for-neck—

“I’ve got it!” exclaimed Harry, breathless as he hovered in the centre of the pitch, Snitch held tightly for all to see. There was a moment’s of pause, and then— 

All of Slytherin burst into thunderous applause, muffling Gryffindor’s groans. Mr. Filch, caught up in the festivities, grunted unhappily. 

“We won! We won! We won!” Draco, caught in the excitement of victory, gave everyone around him a hug. Daphne simply patted his back and laughed; Hermione hugged back equally tightly; Blaise chuckled; Theodore scrunched his nose up in disgust; Mr. Filch stared at him awkwardly until Draco himself realised who he was hugging. 

Down at the pitch, Oliver Wood was cursing the Sorting Hat again. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

After what felt like forever, Terrence finally let go of Harry, swearing bloody vengeance on the soul who 

dared 

jinx the young seeker’s broom. Marcus patted the boy on the back, grunting something inaudible (“He said good job for hanging on and getting back into the game so quick after,” translated Terrence). Even Miles Bletchley, who wasn’t on the right footing with Harry just yet, gave the boy a slight nod of acknowledgement. Slytherin had won two-hundred-twenty to seventy, thanks to the seeker. 

“Harry!” The moment the boy left the Slytherin locker rooms, he was ambushed by Hermione, who engulfed him in a tight hug, closely followed by Draco, who didn’t want to be left out. “We were so worried!” 

“You smell awful!” said Draco, reeling back in disgust. 

While he had been on the broom, Harry had been 

terrified

, but now that he was on the ground, surrounded by his fellow first years, Draco’s complaints ringing in his ears… Harry felt like he was at 

home

. “Thanks, Draco.” said Harry softly, his heart buzzing warmly. 

The other two stared at him in confusion, making Harry laugh at their faces. His laugh must’ve been contagious, for the next thing they knew, all three snakes were laughing, their giggles dancing in the late afternoon sky. The sweet moment, however, was interrupted when Professor Snape cleared his throat, looking awkward. 

“Congratulations on the game, Mr. Potter,” said the Slytherin Head of House, his gaze softening for a moment. “If you’d kindly turn over your broom for inspection…” 

Harry had never been so relieved in his entire life. If the professor hadn’t offered to check it, Harry didn’t think he’d ever feel safe on his Nimbus ever again. Knowing that Professor Snape was going to inspect it for any jinxes or curses helped Harry feel a tad bit reassured. 

“And as for you, Ms. Granger,” said the professor, raising an eyebrow. The muggleborn stiffened her shoulders but didn’t back down, staring right back at the potions master defiantly. “... Ten points for 

excellent 

use of blue fire.” 

Blinking in surprise, Harry and Draco looked between the professor and their friend, feeling that there was some sort of secret between the two that the boys weren’t let in on. Hermione kept her calm demeanor, although the corner of her lips twitched into a smile. 

“Thank you, Professor,” Hermione replied, “I learnt it from one of your books, sir.” 

Professor Snape smiled unexpectedly, scaring all three of the Slytherins. “That’s good to hear. The three of you better hurry back to the commons. I hear there’s a celebration for today’s victory.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

It was custom for Severus to drop by Minerva’s office for a drink after a Gryffindor-Slytherin match, if only they could watch the other mope in defeat. However, after the first game of the 1991 season, the potions master sent off a hurried patronus, a doe that cantered among the shadowy willows, informing the transfiguration professor of his tardiness beforehand. He had 

other 

matters to tend to. 

“Quirrell,” snarled Severus, no patience or mercy left for the stuttering man before him. “Would you like to explain yourself?” 

“S-S-Severus,” stuttered the defense professor, glancing shiftily around them. Severus had cornered the man before he had the chance to get away, pulling his colleague into the cover of the forest in order to avoid any stray students. “I-I-I don’t know what you m-m-mean…” 

Resisting the urge to curse, Severus growled threateningly, glaring at the shivering man as menacingly as he could. “I wasn’t the only witness of your little hocus-pocus, 

Quirinus

. Try 

anything 

again…”

The threat was left hanging in the air for Quirrell to fill in for himself. Without another word, the potions master swished his robes, stepping past the brambles littered across the forest floor silently, leaving Quirrell to contemplate his decisions alone.

Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Draco wasn’t particularly keen on heading down to Hagrid’s hut in the first place, and Ron’s presence simply gave him more of a reason to be repelled. None of the Slytherins had expected to run into the redhead when they knocked on the half-giant’s door, all of their jaws dropping when they spotted the Weasley on the couch, a cup of hot tea in his hands. “... Hi,” said Harry at last, rather awkwardly. Draco was glaring fiercely at the redhead, while Hermione was looking around the hut interestingly, avoiding eye-contact at all costs. “S-Sorry,” blurted Ron out of nowhere, having got up from the couch abruptly. This snatched Draco and Hermione’s attention instantly, the other two Slytherins staring at the Weasley like they’d never seen him before. “Er— Hermione. Sorry… Er— for what I said to you. That was… Mean of me.” Unsure of how to reply, Hermione glanced at Harry, who nodded encouragingly. Taking a deep breath, the muggleborn stepped forward, reaching out a hand tentatively. “Apology accepted,” said Hermione at last, her smile widening when Ron shook her head. “... Friends?” Ron still looked rather awkward, but he grinned in reply. “Friends. As long as you promise to help me with that spell.” “Deal,” Hermione said, smiling. Behind her, Draco groaned— now that Ron had apologised to Hermione, and Harry seemed to have forgiven the boy too, the blonde had no other choice but to stop being hostile to the other. “Weasley,” said Draco, grumbling with his arms crossed. “Malfoy,” Ron said carefully. “... Truce?” “Truce.” While this was unfolding, Hagrid glanced around from first-year to first-year like he was watching a four-way tennis game. The half-giant was holding a plate of rock cakes, having been in the process of serving Ron, but that had been interrupted by a display of a Gryffindor-Slytherin truce that took place in the middle of his living room. “Oh!” said Ron suddenly, as if he remembered something. “My brother— Bill— he’s a cursebreaker for Gringotts.” The three Slytherins stared at him incredulously, unable to figure out why the redhead believed this information was relevant out of nowhere. Seeing their confused expressions, Ron continued hastily,“He told me— when I was younger— that in order to jinx something, you need to maintain continuous eye-contact,” explained Ron, looking urgent. “Just now— during the game— Snape was holding eye-contact with Potter— er— Harry’s— broom, all while muttering under his breath! At one point, he got distracted by something and Harry’s broom stopped misbehaving— that can’t be a coincidence—” Before he could finish, Draco snorted in laughter, cutting him off. “Hold on, hold on— you think Uncle Severus would jinx his  own seeker? Seriously?” Ron opened his mouth to refute, then closed it again. On second thought, the blonde did seem to have a point— why on Earth would Snape jinx his own seeker? “It wasn’t Professor Snape who was jinxing Harry’s broom,” Hermione interjected, “In fact, it was quite the opposite. He was performing the counter-jinx. The one who was jinxing Harry’s broom was in fact Professor Quirrell, who  was maintaining eye-contact while muttering a lurching jinx under his breath.” The half-giant had been about to interrupt with his own two cents, saying that Professor Snape would never do such a thing onto a student, that the professors were tasked with protecting Hogwarts’ children. Hagrid was nodding appreciatively while Hermione defended her Head of House, only to have his eyes blown wide when the girl turned around and accused  another professor. “Now now,” Hagrid said, “Quirinus would never! What reason would he have to jinx Harry’s broom outta nowhere—” The muggleborn snapped her head around and fixed the groundskeeper with her hardest stare. “I  heard  Professor Quirrell muttering the exact incantation of the jinx. A few people— other than me— witnessed him maintaining eye-contact the whole time with Harry’s broom. The moment Professor Quirrell got distracted, Harry’s broom stopped lurching. Do you have a better explanation for that? There were a few seconds between Professor Snape’s breaking of eye-contact and the moment when Harry’s broom stopped misbehaving. On the other hand, the effect was  instantaneous  when Professor Quirrell lost  his contact.” “How do you know this?” asked Ron suspiciously, raising an eyebrow. The muggleborn girl smiled secretively. Clearly, there was something she wasn’t telling them. “That’s for me to know and you to guess. Anyway, all I can say is that I’m completely sure it was Professor Quirrell. Professor Snape was trying to save his seeker, for goodness’s sake.” “Alright, if you say so,” Ron said, sounding rather unsure. “Oh, right— you guys remember Cerberus, right? I wonder if it’s still there—” “If you’re suggesting for us to go check, the answer is an absolute  no  ,” refuted Hermione instantly, Harry nodding hurriedly behind her. “We are  not going back there. I don’t want to die before I graduate, thanks.” Hagrid, who was frozen at first mention of the three-headed dog, snapped back into his senses. “Hang on a min’,” he said, looking wild, “YOU GUYS SAW FLUFFY?” “Your human-sized dog is called  Fang  ,” Harry took a deep breath, shooting the half-giant an incredulous expression. “But your three-headed, able-to-gobble-me-up-in-one-bite dog, er, dogs, is called  Fluffy ?” “That’s  your  dog?” yelled Ron, over all the yelling that was already going on. “Why the hell would you keep it in a bloody castle filled with  children ?” “To be fair, they  did warn us not to go near the third floor corridor,” said Hermione. “You guys went down the third floor corridor,” said Draco, looking between the other three first years, “And you didn’t bring me? You guys are  awful , my father will be—” “We were in the same room as a life-threatening dog because of  you  ,” shot back Hermione quickly, “If you hadn’t challenged Ron to a wizard’s duel, Harry and I wouldn’t have been there at  midnight trying to send him back to the Gryffindor tower before he got caught by Filch—” Hagrid, who was still trying to wrap his head around the matter, yelled again: “YOU GUYS SAW FLUFFY?” “ Yes  , Hagrid,  we did ,” said Hermione impatiently, “Neville was there, too.” “We’ve got to go back tonight!” declared Draco, who was determined not to miss out on the experience of standing before a hungry, three-headed dog. “I  must see this Fluffy you speak of—” “No!” yelled Harry, at the same time Hermione said: “Absolutely not!” “Hagrid, you still haven’t answered me on  why in bloody hell someone would keep a Cerberus in a bloody school —” Hermione rolled her eyes, as if the answer was as simple as one plus one. “Well  duh , it’s guarding something! Didn’t you see the trapdoor it was standing on?” “WELL I’M SORRY I WAS TOO BUSY TRYING NOT TO DIE!” Fang, excited by all the yelling, barked happily to insert his two knuts. “THAT’S ENOUGH, YOU LOT FORGET ALL ‘BOUT FLUFFY AND THAT TRAPDOOR, THAT’S BETWEEN DUMBLEDORE AND NICOLAS FLAMEL—” yelled Hagrid hurriedly, not realising the fatal mistake he had just made. “Oh, so the thing under the trapdoor has something to do with Nicolas Flamel?” said Hermione smartly, raising an eyebrow. Hagrid stopped right in the middle of his tracks, looking like a deer caught in headlights.“I thought you said we were going to stay as far as possible from Cerberu— er, Fluffy?” said Harry, staring at Hermione wildly. It didn’t take a genius to figure out from the girl’s curious look that she was invested in this mystery now. “I said we were going to stay away from it, it doesn’t mean we can’t figure out what it’s hiding,” said the muggleborn, brushing him off. Harry looked at Draco for support, but the blonde was eager to get a foot in their ‘adventures’ and was supporting Hermione. Ron wasn’t much help either— while he didn’t look keen at the idea of wandering right into Fluffy’s claws once more, he  did look interested in the whole ordeal. Meanwhile, Hagrid crossed his arms, looking really, really cross at himself. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Never, in his entire life, had Severus anticipated that James Potter’s Quidditch talent would win Slytherin a match. Then again, he never would’ve thought Harry James Potter would become one of his snakes. The potions master snorted as he imagined his former nemesis rolling in the afterlife, throwing a fit at the idea of his son, the Slytherin seeker responsible for Gryffindor’s defeat. In all seriousness, Harry was nothing that Severus had expected. Instead of being a spoilt, pampered child that demanded to have everything his way, the boy was mild-mannered, kind and polite, reminding the professor of the late Mrs. Evans. Lily’s parents had always treated him as their own son, allowing him to hide under their roof whenever Tobias Snape got too drunk for his mother to handle. For a moment, he remembered the soothing, gentle voice of Carol Evans, her dark red hair tied in a loose, low-hanging ponytail as she finished off a bedtime story. Severus would never admit it aloud, but somewhere in his hardened, cold, heart, there was already a spot reserved for a small, emerald-eyed child. In some alternate reality where he hadn’t become a Death Eater, Severus wondered if he would’ve been Harry’s godfather, just like he was Draco’s. The thought of watching the boy grow from a little infant, swaddled in broomstick-patterned blankets, into a confident young adult that expanded the borders of the potions industry as they knew it— if only things had turned out that way. There was no turning back, however. Severus took his first step towards the dark side, and it had become a lifelong commitment with his life as the deposit. It was selfish of him, given his position as a spy that thread the line between the dark and the light, but Severus still wanted to be a part of Harry’s life. Yes, the boy was no longer an infant, and they had a few missteps here and there, but Severus was willing to put in the work needed to gain Harry’s trust back. Lily’s child had a heart of gold, one that was able to forgive as easily as that. It wasn’t something Severus approved of— forgiving easily didn’t end well for most— but as it was, it worked in his favour, and the man wasn’t going to let that chance slip away from him. He had failed Lily once. He let Dumbledore leave Harry in the hands of the Dursleys, and honestly, it was a miracle the boy was still able to communicate with others, given how abusive the environment sounded. He wasn’t going to fail Lily  twice . Harry would be at Hogwarts nine months out of twelve— unless the Dursleys made him go back during winter break, he supposed. It was unlikely, but he would find out soon. His snakes would be submitting the papers needed if they wanted to return for Christmas, which would empty the castle out. If Harry stayed behind, then Severus would have time to plan his way closer to the green-eyed child he was starting to… Like. As he worked his way through the stack of third-year essays, another idea occurred to the potions master. Since Harry was friends with Draco, he could always pull a connection from that side. Narcissa would no doubt allow Harry to stay at the Malfoy Manor over the holidays if Draco asked for it. While he was unsure of Lucius’s view on the boy-who-lived, Lord Malfoy wouldn’t dare harm the child in any way in fear of it affecting his political position. In fact, Lucius might even attempt to get on Harry’s good side. Not only would that dispel the rumours of the man being a bearer of the Dark Mark, it could even boost Lucius’s position in the ministry. Severus stifled a chuckle as he continued to think about Harry’s connections. The boy, unknowingly, was building himself an alliance with the very side that used to want him dead. Harry had established a connection with the houses of Malfoy and Greengrass, and on top of that, he was close friends with a muggleborn, which would put him in good light with the halfbloods and muggleborns. While he didn’t seem very close to Theodore and Blaise, both heirs of the Nott and Zabini houses respectively, there was no doubt that over the next seven years, Harry could build plenty of connections. It seemed as if Harry had a talent for making people… Adore him. An example of this would be the two main leaders of Severus’s Quidditch team— Terrence and Marcus. On the night of Harry’s first Quidditch practice, the two (okay, mainly Terrence) came barging in, explaining his grounds for suspecting an abusive background. It wasn’t uncommon for his snakes to come from such… Families, as most Slytherins tended to come from pureblood lines, and most parents were intent on crafting the perfect heirs for their houses. The Malfoy house, for example, were strict with their only son, expecting him to score top in all his classes and so on. The Parkinson house was the same, except they focused less on academics and more on their daughter needing to find a suitable husband. The Greengrass house, comparatively, was less harsh on their children, but even still, Daphne was expected to act a certain way as she was representing her family. “That kid’s my little brother now,” insisted Terrence, still dressed in his sweaty sports clothes. “Professor, I need to know if they’re mistreating him. He’s way too small for his age, and his instinct to hide— that’s not normal.”Over the years, Severus had thanked Merlin numerous times for placing Terrence in his house. The seventh year was a halfblood, his mother a disgraced pureblood that was shunned from high society because she married a muggle man. Even though his housemates mistreated him for his lineage, Terrence braved through it all, fighting his way to the top in both academics and sports. There was no doubt that the prefect was Slytherin in blood— in his younger years, when his housemates shot jinxes and hexes over corners, Terrence was fast to react with a excellently-executed  protego , refuting with spells of his own. None of the other teachers ever caught him in the act, and if Severus ever caught a glimpse, he turned a blind eye on it. Eventually, his yearmates learned to leave him alone, and through cultivation, Terrence turned that fear into respect. He rose through the Slytherin ranks as a force not to be reckoned with, making his housemates learn, through experience, that behind the harmless smile lay a predator ready to pounce. When consulted about his career choices in fifth year, Terrence answered, without hesitation, that he wanted to become an auror. Severus agreed readily; he definitely had the grades, the skill, and the fast reflex. After all, Terrence  was the seeker who had defeated each of the other houses, time after time. Knowing that Terrence would be keeping an eye out for Harry made Severus a lot more reassured. On top of that— it allowed him to spend more time attending to other matters— such as the matter of one suspicious defense professor. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Chapter 15: Christmas

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

A flurry of forms and a ton of packing later, the students of Hogwarts were ready to hop onto the express for a few weeks of winter break. Much to the dismay of many, the professors piled up on the homework, giving them a couple inches to work through during Christmas. Harry, among the complaints, happily folded his assignments into his bag— they would give him something to do while the castle was empty. 

Most of the Slytherin first years were heading home for Christmas. Draco and Daphne were headed back to their manors, and would be dropping by each other’s residences for Yule. Blaise was headed off to France to spend his holidays with his mother and her eighth husband. Hermione and Tracey were off to London together, and the muggleborn had made the other promise that she would drop by. Vincent and Gregory, commonly known as Crabbe and Goyle, were also going back home. Luckily for Harry, Theodore would be staying back as well, so the boys’ dorm wouldn’t be completely empty. 

The morning the train was set to depart, Harry, Hermione and Draco went for a walk around the grounds, all wrapped up in their cloaks and green scarves. Across the courtyard, the Weasley twins had managed to charm snowballs so that they repetitively attacked the back of Quirrell’s head. Harry felt sorry for the defense professor, but Hermione and Draco, two who were convinced that the man had tried to throw their friend off his broom, had no such sentiments. Unbeknownst to them, the spell that the two were using had come from an… Unexpected source. 

Leaning against a pillar that gave him a full view of the courtyard below was none other than Severus Snape, sipping on some warm tea as he enjoyed the show. His colleague was getting bombarded by magic snowballs in the back of his turban, which Severus thought was his ‘gift’ to the other for trying to throw his seeker off his broom. Earlier that week, the potions professor had slipped a piece of parchment into one of the twins’ bag, counting on the pranksters to test it out on Quirrell. 

“Merry Christmas, Quirrell.” smirked Severus, making his way back into the castle. 

As the potions master entered his office, he remembered the conversation that had taken place there the previous night. Three knocks, in rapid succession, rang from his door. The wards he had in place told him it was a snake of his, and given the hour, it could no one other than Hermione. Swiping a hand lazily, the door allowed the muggleborn entry, and she stepped into his office, closing the door behind her politely. 

“Ms. Granger,” said Severus tiredly, on his fifth coffee of the night. “I have set up a dropbox outside for you to leave any questions you have, you know what to do.” 

“This is about the Quidditch match.” Hermione corrected, looking serious. 

Sighing, Severus eyed the muggleborn, seeing a fierce determination in her eyes that reminded him of a similar, strong-willed woman he used to know. He was starting to wonder if she should’ve been placed in Ravenclaw instead, given her relentless pursuit of answers. Then again, the girl in front of him was the same girl that set fire onto Quirrell without hesitation, without guilt. Under the right conditions, Hermione Granger could grow into a figure capable of controlling all Britain. 

“There’s no use telling you to keep your head out of the matter, is there?” he asked, already knowing her answer. 

“Probably not.” Hermione answered truthfully. 

“Thought so,” replied Severus wryly. “All I can say is, be careful and don’t run head-long into anything without considering the dangers and consequences beforehand.”

The muggleborn nodded. “... Any chance you’ll tell me what the Cerberus is guarding, sir?” 

“I assure you,” Severus said, smirking. “That the answer will be much sweeter if you find it yourself. If you manage to find your answer by the end of winter break, I’ll award extra marks on your next essay.” 

“Challenge accepted.” 

Severus watched the first-year girl leave, a new spring in her step at the thought of bonus marks. Her brown curls, tied in a low pony with a black ribbon, possibly Daphne’s influence, bounced as she left, a pleased smile on her lips as she made her way back to the dorms. 


Dear Merlin, she reminds me so much of Lily

.

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Harry couldn’t help but feel a little sad as he walked with his friends down to the station. Yes, he was happy to stay back at Hogwarts, which felt more like home than Privet Drive did. On the other hand, however, he would feel rather lonely with the castle so empty.

“— Father promised to buy me a new broom for Christmas, I’m 

sure 

it’s going to be a Nimbus Two Thousand— oh and Mother’s probably getting me new robes for Yule, she always does each year—” Draco was saying, recounting the presents that he had gotten in previous years. “What do your muggles get you?” 

“W-Well, nothing really.” he said, feeling uncomfortable when both his friends gave him sympathetic looks. “It’s not a big deal! They do a lot for me, they give me a place to sleep and they feed me…” 

Hermione and Draco shared a glance. “I’ll send over loads of chocolate.” promised Hermione. “And books! I’ve got lots of good books for you, and they’re in 

excellent 

condition—” 

“I’ll convince Mother to buy some extra robes for you, Merlin knows you’ll need them, the boy-who-lived owns 

not a single 

formal robe, that’s ridiculous—” 

The two continued to chatter, lifting Harry’s spirits as they did so. In the midst of all their talking, they didn’t notice Professor Snape, lingering not too far behind on the station, subtly listening in on their conversation. The Head of Slytherin frowned, his mind moving, whirling as he searched for a solution. It wouldn’t do for Harry Potter to wake up to Christmas with no presents, would it? 

At last, the warning whistle for the train came, last hugs were given and promises to write were called out. The students returning home hurried into the compartments, pushing and scrambling into a pile of chaotic limbs. The professors present did their best to maintain order, but there was only so much they could do when they were handling a bunch of excited children. When everyone was finally on board, the train hooted and chooed as loudly as it could, its engine roaring into life, puffing clouds into the air. Hogwarts’ Express pulled out from Hogsmeade Station, moving slowly at first and gaining pace, Harry waving for as long as he could until Draco and Hermione were nothing but a speck in the distance. 

The green-eyed boy watched for a little longer, staring at the specks of white smoke far, far down. Most of the other professors had left, save for the Head of Slytherin, who was watching the first-year quietly. 

“Come now, Mr. Potter,” said Severus at last, “Unless, of course, you intend to catch a cold before Christmas… In that case, be my guest.” 

Instead of shirking away like he would’ve, a few months ago, Harry simply blushed in embarrassment, picking up the pace after his professor, who was already walking back. The boy had learned that his Head of House, as intimidating as he could be, in his dungeon bat fashion, was all bark and no bite. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

The Slytherin common rooms were typically rather quiet, as anyone making too much noise would almost instantly be told off by Seymore. Now that it was winter break, the dorms under the lake were even quieter than usual, save for the occasional turning of a page. Theodore was seated cozily before the fireplace, idly looking through a book about ancient Norse runes. The heir of the Nott family, from what Harry collected, was not on the best terms with his father and would rather hide out in the castle than confront Lord Nott. 

Since Theodore would be staying over during winter break, Hermione had recruited him into ‘the cause’— ‘the cause’ being the mystery of Nicolas Flamel, and by extension, what Fluffy was protecting. Hermione definitely knew what she was doing, because other than herself, Theodore became the next most invested person in the mystery. 

Which 

was why Theodore had decided to wake Harry up every morning at the crack of dawn so that they could begin their search in the library. 

“Good morning, Madam Pince.” greeted Harry, Theodore tugging him on by the arm. The dark-haired boy had made Harry finish all his homework on the first day so that they would have the rest of their holidays to focus on Flamel.

“Here!” said Theodore cheerfully, dumping a bunch of books on important wizarding figures of the past twenty years. Harry’s eyes bulged out until they were the size of saucers when he saw the height of the pile Theodore had collected. “Let’s get started!” 

The dark-haired boy showed little interest towards his academics, even though he was easily better than ninety-percent of his yearmates without putting much effort. Nothing about the Hogwarts syllabus intrigued the Nott heir, but apparently, vague things such as the identity of Flamel did. They spent a majority of their holidays in the library, and, to be fair, Harry wasn’t complaining. The environment was nice and quiet, as well as warm and well-lit.

Christmas morning finally came, and Harry yawned, stretching his arms like a cat to get his bones fully awake. Theodore, a few beds down, was still snoring quietly, curled up in his blankets like a dumpling. Tip-toeing as silently as possible, Harry got out of bed, his eyes widening when he spotted the pile of presents at the foot of his bed. Sure, he knew that Draco and Hermione had promised to send stuff— but he hadn’t expected to receive 

that 

many things. 

“Morning, Theo.” greeted Harry gently, watching the other boy grumble and burrow himself back into his sheets. Clearly, the Nott heir was not a morning person. “Merry Christmas.” 

By the time Theo managed to pull himself out of bed, Harry had already gotten dressed and was in the process of slowly going through the presents he got. It wasn’t often that he received things other than a clothes hanger or a singular sock for Christmas, so he wanted to make his presents last as long as he could. The first one he looked at was a letter from the Dursleys. A week ago, he had gathered some nice chocolates, wrapped them up nicely in parchment and ribbon, sending Hedwig off with them. He gave the owl specific instructions to deliver the mail at 

night

, in fear that Uncle Vernon would scream bloody murder at the snowy. 

“What’s that?” asked Theo, half sleepy and half curious, pointing at the round metal that the Dursleys had attached in their return letter. 

“It’s a pence,” explained Harry, holding it up for the other boy to take. Theo was still dressed in his green, silk pajamas, but he was looking a lot more awake now that his interest was snagged. “Muggle currency.” 

“Interesting…” hummed the other, inspecting the coin, holding it up to the light to look closely at the human head printed onto the coin. 

Harry, amused by Theodore’s interest, spoke: “You can keep it if you want. I don’t mind.” 

Besides the pence, there was a box of Muggle chocolate, signed by Hermione. Along with it came a stack of books, 

not 

signed, because Hermione would 

never 

write anything on one of her precious books. Harry skimmed over the titles, finding each one of them interesting— the muggleborn definitely knew what she was doing when she selected the books to send over. 

There was also an intricate flute, wrapped inside some old, brown paper. When Harry put it to his lips, a song sung by woodland owls rang from the other side, filling the Slytherin dorm with a melodious tune. Theodore glanced away from his pence to find the source of the noise, impressed by the handwork taken to make such an instrument. To their great surprise, this gift was from Hagrid, who, neither of them had expected to have the skill to create something so small and delicate. 

As promised, Draco sent over a couple robes, most in lovely shades of dark green that complimented Harry’s eyes. A few of the robes were too extravagant and dramatic for Harry’s liking, but there were one or two that were relatively simple, with only a few, graceful silver trails along the fabric to add some flair. 

Theodore snorted. “Trust Draco to get you 

clothing 

of all things.” 

A sharp contrast from the formal wear that Draco had sent was a lumpy package, which, when opened, revealed an emerald green sweater with a giant ‘H’ stitched on in white. Harry couldn’t, for his life, fathom who would go through the trouble of hand-knitting him a sweater until Theodore picked up the attached note and handed it over to him. 

“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry said, bewildered by the name on the card. “Why would she send me a sweater?” 

“Beats me.” Theodore shrugged. “Then again, you’re quite popular. Maybe she wants to get on your good side.” 

Regardless, Harry slipped the sweater on, sighing happily when he felt how warm it was around him. The yarn was soft and not prickly, rather like what Harry imagined 

clouds

 would feel like. In his mind, he made a note to send a letter thanking the woman who he met on the platform for her sweater. 

The next present was unsigned and the sender anonymous. It was wrapped in dark paper, but from the weight and shape of it, Harry guessed that it was a book. His guess was right— it was a book titled ‘The Mechanisms of Potion-Making’. The book wasn’t new, if the chipped edges were anything to go by. On top of that, there was a note on the first page, written with ink, in elaborate cursive: 


Merry Christmas

. — 

E.Prince 


Harry didn’t think that ‘E.Prince’ was the one who had sent the book to him— the ink was old and smudged. It didn’t look like it was freshly written at all. It seemed as if the sender had received the book from ‘E.Prince’ some time ago, and had decided to re-gift it to him. Harry didn’t mind, though— the book did look rather interesting. He flipped through the pages, glancing at the little sketches and diagrams until at last he spotted the corner of a picture, snuggled among the pages. 

The green-eyed boy stared, in complete shock, reaching out for the photo. It could move, just like Dumbledore's card and the portraits in the hallways. Inside the picture was an auburn-haired woman, laughing as she spun, her light summer dress flapping around her as radiant gold rays lit up her motions. The woman turned, looking right into the eyes of the person taking the picture— but now that Harry was holding the picture, it felt like Lily Evans was looking into 

his 

eyes, instead. 

“... Is that your mother?” asked Theodore quietly, standing behind him. 

Realizing, all of a sudden, that there were tears dripping down his cheek, Harry wiped them away, feeling embarrassed. “I… I think so.” he said quietly, running his thumb over the picture gently. The photo was replaying— Harry felt like he could watch it forever, watching his mother spin in her pretty white dress, laughing and smiling under the summer sun. 

“... She’s pretty.” said Theodore at last, sitting down on the floor next to Harry. 

“Yeah, she is.” Harry sniffled, desperate not to get any tears on his mother’s photo. The longer he looked, the surer he was that the woman was his mother. She shared a resemblance with Petunia Dursley— their eyes were the same shape. 

“... Do you want to see my mother?” 

Not having expected to hear that, Harry glanced up to see Theodore sitting down next to him, a locket in his hands. The other boy caressed the metal decorations fondly, running his fingers along the sides gently, like it was a piece of metal glass. Curious, Harry shuffled closer to get a better look. Theodore felt around the locket for a small, cylindrical metal piece that could be twisted— as he did, the front of the locket popped open, revealing the picture of a beautiful, young woman with the same curly, brown locks that Theodore had. She was smiling gracefully, the same locket Theodore was holding around her neck. 

“She’s really beautiful.” commented Harry softly. 

“Yeah.” Theodore said wistfully, staring longingly at the picture of his mother. “... Don’t say sorry.”

“I won’t.” Harry knew that the other boy didn’t want his sympathy— Theodore wanted someone to 

understand

 instead of apologizing for the absence of his mother, which, more often than not, made things worse instead of better. While Harry understood that most people were just trying to offer their condolences, as a means of paying respect, the word ‘sorry’ had a tendency to make the pain hurt more. 

The two sat in silence, shuffling closer so that they could feel the heat of each other’s bodies. Somehow, in the light of the Christmas morning, Theodore and Harry reached a new understanding, bringing them closer than before. 

“... Hey, Harry?” 

“Yeah?” 

“Merry Christmas.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Severus didn’t know if he should just 

keep quiet 

or barge into the headmaster’s office, demanding an explanation. The silvery fabric sat, crumpled, on his desk, practically 

mocking 

him with its sheen. The cloak that should’ve been with the Potters on their last night— the cloak that should’ve made the difference between life and death— the cloak that should’ve protected his childhood best friend, kept her safe from the Dark Lord’s murderous intent, ensured her survival… 

Instead of being with them when they needed it the most, the cloak was in the hands of no other person but 

Albus Dumbledore

. 

At first, Severus thought it was incredibly paranoid of him to sift through the gifts sent to Harry before they were actually delivered to his dorm, but now? He was thanking his paranoia. Why the headmaster thought it was a good idea to give a first-year an invisibility cloak, of all things— despite it belonging to his late father, it was still a promise of trouble, from 

every 

angle. 

Unless… Unless that was exactly what the headmaster wanted. The very thought made Severus’s blood 

boil

. He had always known that Albus’s actions went deeper than the first reason, that there was always an underlying cause, an underlying effect that would settle on them like falling dominos. But to go as far as setting the dominos for an 

eleven-year-old child

— 

Lily’s 

eleven-year-old child, no less— that was too much. 

Irritated, Severus took another glare at the cloak, watching its shimmery sheen under the flicker of the candlelight. Yes, the item belonged to Harry, no doubt— but whether or not Severus should leave it in the boy’s supervision, twenty-four-seven… Severus had a feeling that Harry, himself, wouldn’t use the cloak to get into any sort of mischief, but those around him could have different thoughts. Draco, for one. Hermione, for another. 

While he knew the other two children meant no harm, Draco’s personality, instilled by his father’s ways, and Hermione’s ruthless curiosity— there was no saying how far those two components could go. Next thing he knew, Harry bloody Potter would be knee-deep in another troll encounter, or 

worse

. 

The whole matter was a headache. Severus sighed, rubbing his temple. It was 

Christmas

, for Merlin’s sake! Why was he stressing out on such a matter when he should be 

enjoying 

himself, enjoying the lack of noise in the echoing castle? Deciding to continue his pondering on a later date, Severus chucked the cloak into one of his desk drawers, before coming back on second thought to fold it properly. While he had some resentment for the cloak due to who it 

used 

to belong to, it was now Harry’s, and honestly, the cloak was innocent and didn’t deserve to be carelessly thrown around like that. 

Making sure that his security charms were in place, Severus swooped out of his office, headed to the festivities of the Great Hall. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Thankfully, Theodore decided that for Christmas, they could make 

one 

exception. However much Harry loved the library, he wasn’t particularly keen on spending their whole morning among the shelves, delving into more research. Plus, he had a feeling that Madam Pince would throw the two out. So there he was, seated in the Great Hall, enjoying fresh bread and pudding, a commodity he would’ve never gotten to enjoy at Privet Drive. 
“Well look who it is, Fred.” exclaimed a voice. The next thing he knew, Harry was being flocked by a pair of redheads, wearing identical grins and sweaters with a giant ‘F’ and ‘G’. “Our newest sibling, dear, dear Harry.” Only a few steps behind them, looking slightly disgruntled was a messy-haired Percy, his glasses a little askew. The prefect was wearing a sweater like the twins’ and Harry’s, except with a giant ‘P’ instead. Eyeing his twin brothers, Percy sighed, looking both annoyed and apologetic. “... Merry Christmas, Harry.” “Merry Christmas!” beamed Harry in return. “Merry Christmas, Fred, George.” he said, glancing at the respective twin in turn as he spoke their name.
No one thought much of this until the twins both froze in place, jaws dropping. They turned, comedically slowly, to look at each other, and then back at Harry. “H… How did you know I was George?” said the twin with sweater ‘G’, looking amazed. Then, as if he had just remembered, the twin slapped his forehead comedically. “Oh, of course— must’ve been the Weasley sweater that gave it away.” Scrunching his eyebrows, Harry squinted at the said twin, eyeing his sweater doubtfully. “... You’re Fred, aren’t you?” Percy didn’t think his brothers could look any more surprised but they did. “H… How?” said twin ‘F’, his hands thrown in the air. “Impossible!” “Hold on, hold on,” said Percy, now getting a better gist of the situation. “Harry can tell you two apart?” The prefect was starting to catch the twins’ amazement— not even their mother could tell Fred and George from each other, but here came Harry, some random, scrawny kid who could pick the twins apart without batting an eyelash. As if he couldn’t comprehend why that was so hard, Harry tilted his head innocently, looking confused. “... Well, Fred has this darker patch of freckles on his nose, and George tends to move his eyebrows more when he’s talking…” The twins’ jaws dropped, as if they couldn’t believe what was happening. Beside then, Percy huffed triumphantly, perching his arms on his waist to make a point. “See,” Percy said, looking proud. “I made the right decision by adopting him.” Somewhere in Scotland, seated in a cottage, drinking a cup of warm cocoa, Oliver Wood sneezed, cursing the Sorting Hat under his breath.

Chapter 16: A Wintry Morning


Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)




Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

One winter morning a few days before the holidays ended, Harry snuck out early, determined to avoid getting dragged to the library first thing that day. Lucky for him, Theodore had stayed up late, deciphering a book written in ancient Norse that he found in the midst of research. Creeping past the snoring boy, Harry tip-toed out of the Slytherin dorms, dressed in his warmest cloak, the key to Slytherin’s broom racks snuggled in his pockets. Marcus had pressed the small metal to his hands in the commons on the day the train left, insisting Harry get practice in whenever he could. 

Now trudging along happily with his— er, Marcus’s spare broom, Harry began thinking of some manoeuvres Terrence had shown him during practice, as well as some tricks he read up in a Quidditch book. Already feeling excited at the thought of flying, the boy skipped his way towards the pitch, but not before catching sight of a black figure descending the white hills towards the forest. 

“Out so early, Mr. Potter?” said Professor Snape with a raised eyebrow as they intercepted each others’ paths. 

“Yes, sir.” replied Harry enthusiastically, his breath fanning white clouds into the air. 

The potions master huffed and said nothing more, continuing on his steady descent towards the Forbidden Forest. To his surprise, the emerald-eyed boy trudged after him, stumbling through the thick snow with the grace of a newborn deer. Deciding against making a remark, the two walked in silence, the air between them filled with Severus’s quiet breaths and Harry’s occasional yelp when he stumbled over twigs and roots. 

“Don’t step on that.” said Severus abruptly as they neared the beginning of the forest, their path already littered with small ferns and plants. Harry stopped immediately, his curious eyes flicking to the plant the professor was pointing at. “That’s a species of hawberry. Remember their properties, Mr. Potter?” 

Pausing to recall the information, Harry answered: “They have a tendency to increase the, em, wateriness—"

“Viscosity,” interjected Severus. 

“— viscosity,” corrected Harry, “of potions, and… they can also be used to lower the toxicity of many draughts.” 

“Indeed.” hummed the professor approvingly. Without noticing what he was doing, the older man ruffled Harry’s hair, only catching himself when the boy squirmed in protest. Clearing his throat, Severus feigned ignorance when Harry, too, realised what had just happened. The man squatted down to get a closer look at the plant. “Wild hawberries can defer in properties and reactivity as to grown ones.” commented the professor, gesturing at the plant. “This makes them better suited for certain concoctions.” 

Harry nodded attentively, shelving the information so he could jot it down in his textbook when he got back into the castle. 

“Watch carefully now, Mr. Potter.” said Severus, pulling up the sleeves of his robe. “No matter what plant you’re dealing with, the method of harvest greatly affects the effectiveness of the ingredient. A damaged plant does your potion no good.” 

“Yes sir.” nodded the boy vigorously, scuffling closer to get a better look. 

The potions master paused. “... Mr. Potter, you’re blocking my view.” 

Blushing furiously, the boy stumbled out of the way hurriedly, using his thick, floofy hair to hide his embarrassment. “Sorry.” mumbled Harry, cheeks flushed in a great shade of Gryffindor red. “Didn’t mean to, Professor.” 

Flicking Harry’s forehead gently, the potions master scowled. “If your objective was to trample half the plants behind you, Mr. Potter, you’ve succeeded. Stop moving and 

watch

.” 

The potions master wrapped his calloused fingers around the base of the plant, tugging the whole herb, roots and all, out of the snowy ground, occasionally feeding Harry little bits of information about how the different parts of the hawberry could be used. When the whole plant was out of the ground, the professor muttered a quick spell to keep it fresh, dusting off any clinging dirt before tucking it carefully into his coat. 

“Come along now, Mr. Potter. I don’t have all morning.” said Severus frostily, watching Harry from the corner of his sight as the boy looked all around him in awe. “Before we enter the forest, let me warn you that it is strictly 

forbidden 

for students to wander in here alone. Unless, of course, you desire an early death.” 

Harry jumped at the thought. 

“There are many unpredictable dangers in the forest, and not just living ones.” warned the professor, “I expect you to follow 

exactly as I say 

if you are following me inside. All instructions are 

final

. Is that clear?” 

“Yes sir.” 

“It better be. Don’t wander too far and stay close.”

Now made jittery by his Head of House’s ominous warnings, Harry stuck close to the lanky professor, never more than a step behind the man. His emerald eyes flitted from side to side, glancing at blurry patches of the foliage where he heard noises from. The boy was warrier than a baby kitten without its mother in a dark alley. 

Under his breath, Severus muttered a few protection spells, watching as they wrapped themselves around Harry, dissolving into the material of the boy’s coat. He was confident that he could take on any danger he crossed within the perimeter of the forest, but a little precaution didn’t hurt. Plus, he was used to defending himself and himself only— it was possible that the boy could get hurt in the crossfire if they met a form of threat. 

On second thought, Severus decided to reroute his journey. His intention was to head into the middle of the forest for some herbs that only grew there, but now that he had one of his snakes— such a young one, nonetheless— tagging along, it would be smarter to skirt on the edge of the forest and avoid the menaces of the depths. After all, he could always return on a later date for any additional ingredients he needed. 

As they walked, the potions master would stop and gesture to a plant around them, quizzing the younger on them before showing the boy how to harvest it, the plant’s properties, and any other information he deemed relevant. Harry’s tag-along was very quickly turning Severus’s ingredient trip into a spontaneous field-trip. 

“What plant do you suppose this is, Mr. Potter?” said Severus, stopping once again to point. 

“Snowy daisies, sir!” chirped Harry, spotting the clump of white flowers that Severus was referring to. “It’s used in a household potion to remove odour.” 

“Hmm. And what property of it contributes to the odour-repelling potion?” countered the older Slytherin, a smirk appearing on his face when the boy faltered. 

Harry hesitated, ransacking through his knowledge bank before coming up empty. “I… I’m not sure, sir.” he answered truthfully, looking guilty. The boy had studied his textbook cover to cover, and he wondered if he had, somehow, missed the little tidbit of information when he skimmed past the pages. 

“There are many answers to which you cannot find in the textbook, Mr. Potter.” advised Severus, “Critical thinking is just as important as remembering read knowledge.”

Without saying another word, the potions professor continued on, glancing around at the plants growing underfoot. Harry tagged along, pondering about what the man had said. Yes— knowledge was knowledge, but the difference between being clever and smart was knowing 

how 

to use that knowledge— 

wisely

. 

Severus walked a couple more strides, staring at some half-frozen vines hanging from the empty branches above before realising that Harry had fallen behind. Just as he was about to make an angry remark— what had he said about the boy following closely, not wandering far— Harry spoke. 

“Is this a winter honeysuckle, sir?” asked the boy, letting the flower droop gently in his palm. He caressed the thin petals with his thumb, careful to avoid bending the pistils at the centre. 

“... Indeed.” Severus said after a short pause, adding absent-mindedly, “Your mother used to put these in her hair. Now, stop dallying and hurry along.”

The potions master walked on, his face twitching in irritation when he didn’t hear the boy following him. Spinning on his heels, Severus glowered, speaking: “Mr. Potter, I don’t like to repeat myself. We don’t have all…” The older man faltered, sensing a shift in atmosphere— Harry was staring at him, slightly teary-eyed, still holding the flower in his palm. 

“You knew my mother…?” whispered Harry, his eyes brimming at the edge with a thin sheen of tears. 

“I— well,” Although it was rather unlike him, Severus fumbled with his words, unsure of how to approach the unfolding situation. “... Yes, I did.” he admitted at last, “We grew up in the same neighbourhood and… We attended Hogwarts together. We were… friends. Her parents… Let me stay over in their house many times when I was younger.”

“... If I can ask, sir…” said Harry, shyly, “... What was my mother like…?” 

Severus frowned. “Did your aunt not tell you anything about your mother?”

“No.” said Harry, shaking his head. “Aunt Petunia burned everything belonging to her, and if I asked about my parents I wouldn’t be allowed to have dinner.” On second thought, the boy added: “Although she did say that they were drunks, and that they never wanted me anyway…” 

“Ridiculous!” exclaimed Severus angrily, gripping his wand tightly in his hand. Suddenly, the man had a very strong urge to pay an impromptu visit to Privet Drive. “Your mother would’ve never! She swore off alcohol when she was carrying you— and James Potter was many things, yes, but he wasn’t a drunk.” 

As much as Severus detested the former Gryffindor Chaser, he had to admit that James Potter loved no one more in the world than Lily, and that the man was a good husband 

and 

father, for as long as he lived. Yes, he was an annoying arse during their school years, but Severus knew without a doubt that James Potter would’ve never done anything that might’ve placed either his wife or child in danger, for he loved them more than life itself. 

Severus scoffed under his breath, avoiding the young snake’s puppy eyes at all costs. With a dramatic swish of his coat, he turned and began trekking through the undergrowth again even though he could literally hear the boy slump in disappointment. Despite it, Harry picked up the pace and stuck close behind Severus, staring sadly at his feet. 

“Your mother was exceptional at potions,” said Severus quietly, inspecting a plant he had gathered as they walked. From the peripheral of his vision, Harry brightened visibly. As an afterthought, he added: “... Just as you are.” 

When the young boy didn’t say anything, the potions master continued: “She was pursuing a charms degree while carrying you, in the middle of the war. Lily… Well, there was nothing she couldn’t do if she set her mind to it.” 

“She was the kindest person I knew. When she was young, she loved going out during the summer to lie on the grass outside her house, and she loved to read.” Subconsciously, a fond smile had slipped onto Severus’s face as he talked about a friend he used to hold dear. “While she was at Hogwarts, she was every teacher’s favourite. Professor Flitwick, especially, loved her as she excelled at his class. Slughorn recruited her into that club of his,” Severus rolled his eyes as he spoke of his former potions professor, “Because he wanted to maintain connection with her in case she ever became famous one day.” 

“She was a Gryffindor, right?” piped Harry. 

“Yes.” agreed Severus, “She was a lion through and through. She was never afraid to stand up to others, even her own friends. Lily was someone who strongly believed in her own morals and would fight for them. Minerva— well, Professor McGonagall adored having her in her house, and made her a prefect in her final years at the school.” 

Harry’s eyes were shining like stars, a constellation in the pool of the black galaxy. “What about my dad, then?” 

Coughing awkwardly, Severus cleared his throat, his mind darting around to think of an excuse so he wouldn’t have to sing praises about James Potter to the junior Potter. Not that he had that many praises to sing, anyway. “He was an auror. A brave one, I suppose. To put it lightly… he was a bit of a troublemaker during his school years.” 

The boy preened, waiting to hear more. 

“He… fought during the war,” managed Severus, resisting the urge to shudder at the thought of dodging James Potter’s fiercely-casted spells and hexes. “A decent duellist, I suppose.” ‘Decent’ was putting it 

really 

lightly. 

“What was his favourite subject?” chirped Harry, skipping on the snow-covered ground now. 

“... Transfiguration, if I had to guess.” Severus shrugged, recalling when Minerva burst into the staffroom— 

he has his father’s talent for transfiguration

, she said— “Professor McGonagall always held him highly. Perhaps he was her star student. I didn’t know him very well, and you’d be better off asking Professor McGonagall.” 

They walked back into the stone courtyard together, Severus changing the subject from James Potter (thankfully) back to Lily, who he had plenty to talk about. Harry beamed happily as he absorbed all the stories about his young, red-haired, bright-eyed mother as the potions master allowed himself a small indulgence into his past. Eventually, they descended back towards the dungeons, Severus purposely glancing away when the duo crossed paths with Filius, who looked astonished at the sight of the two. 

“Harvesting and storing ingredients, although not part of the syllabus, are also important skills that are necessary to learn,” said Severus, looking distasteful as he flicked his office door open with his wand. “However, the headmaster believes that if these topics were added to the syllabus, our failing percentage would increase.” 

The potions master paused. 

“Picking up such skills can give you a… headstart.” Severus shepherded Harry into the personal lab behind his office, “You’d be surprised to know what a disadvantage majority of the British students have when studying for a potions mastery, simply because the Hogwarts syllabus doesn’t involve pre-brewing techniques.” 

Wide-eyed and curious, Harry peered over his professor as the man unpacked all the plants he had collected on his trip on a long, sleek work table. Severus noticed the cute, bunny-like way the boy pricked up at every noise and sound, but elected to ignore it in favour of his ingredients (and dignity). The man began gathering the materials he would need with a slight flick of his hands— a polished, imported stone cutting board, his collection of differently-purposed knives, pestle and mortar. They all came flying from various directions, careful to leave a wide radius around Harry, who was staring in awe.

“Mr. Potter, retrieve a jar from the shelf behind you,” Severus waved a hand in the loose direction of the shelf he was speaking of, distracted by the work at hand. Immediately, the young snake scurried off, carefully picking one from the plethora of glass jars the potions master had in his possession. 

“Is this one okay?” asked Harry, looking absolutely tiny next to his lanky professor. 

The Head of Slytherin glanced away from his work to nod approvingly, taking the jar from the snake. “Bursting mushrooms,” he spoke as he placed a couple of the red-spotted fungi into the mortar. “Are rather explosive, as the name suggests. I told you earlier that when harvesting them, you must 

not

 touch the gills. Why is this so?” 

“Because bursting mushrooms release a slightly toxic powder when the gills are touched.” recited Harry confidently, recalling information from the earlier morning. 

“That’s correct.” Severus, with all the care and grace of an experienced master, took apart the mushroom, separating the head and stem of the fungi. “Look closely here. These are the mycelium threads,” he prodded gently at the hair-like structures at the bottom of the stem. “Most inexperienced potioneers ignore them, but they’re actually really helpful in many potions.” 

They continued for another hour or so, Severus chopping, dicing, crushing the ingredients he brought back. Some were powdered and kept away in mason jars, a quick spell keeping them moisture from penetrating. Some were flattened and stored away to be sun-dried on a good day. Others were just separated into parts and stored separately. By the time they were done, it was past 9am, and even though he kept denying it, Harry’s stomach vouched for breakfast. 

“As I’m sure Madam Pomfrey will say, Mr. Potter, breakfast is a crucial meal that one must never skip. If she ever hears of you skipping, I dare say you’ll be in for an hour-long lecture regarding how important it is.” Severus commented dryly, nearly wincing at the lectures Pomfrey had given 

him

 when he was younger. “However…” the man hesitated before resolving his decision. “There is something I would like to show you before we head to the hall.” 

Since Severus didn’t trust Harry enough to leave him in his personal lab unsupervised (heck, he didn’t trust 

Albus 

in his lab unsupervised), the boy was guided to the office, where he was told to wait while Severus disappeared into his private quarters. Harry didn’t have to wait long, however, as the older Slytherin emerged moments later, carrying a thick, old book. As old as it looked, it was obviously cared for properly, as the only sign of age were the yellowing pages. 

Curious, Harry fixed his gaze on the thick book, like how a puppy would fix its stare on a bone that its owner was waving in front of it. Severus gestured for Harry to seat himself on the couch— the same couch he sat on after the troll incident, when Severus gave them balms for their cuts and bruises— and followed suit. 

The boy was literally vibrating with excitement as Severus carefully flipped the thick cover open. This excitement faded soon as Harry went completely silent, realisation dawning on him as he fully processed what the professor was showing him. 

On the first page of the book, written in a delicate, relatively-simple handwriting with little twirls on the ys: 


Merry Christmas! - For Severus, from Lily 


“Your mother gave this book to me, when we were ten,” explained Severus softly, “She said that all our memories together— we would store them in here.” 

It was weirdly sentimental of him, really. Severus took 

ages 

to open up to people. He had known Poppy for pretty much all his life and had only shown her the album two years ago. But there he was, showing Harry, a boy he had known for barely one semester, the embarrassing, intimate secrets he held close to his heart. If word ever got out that Professor Severus Snape kept an album gifted to him from a Gryffindor— a world-famous Gryffindor whose life ended a war, no less— his reputation would crash. Lucius Malfoy would cut all ties with him at 

once

, and Draco would be instructed never to exchange another word with the man again. 

Then again—

It was Harry, of all people. It was Harry, Lily’s beloved child. It was Harry, just Harry, not the boy-who-lived but the boy-who-never-had-anything-of-his-mother’s because his aunt was a petty old hag. 

Severus supposed he could make an exception, just once. Besides— no one had to know about it. 

“I can’t let you keep it,” said Severus, after a while. Harry had been silent for the past fifteen minutes, wordlessly flipping through the album, tears bordering his eyes as his eleven-year-old mother smiled, grinning at the camera, one arm looped around Severus and the other holding her Hogwarts acceptance letter. Another flip and his mother was wearing her school robes, standing on platform 9 and ¾, Severus, once again, beside her, smiles on their faces. It was as if Harry watched his mother grow up— fifteen-year-old Lily in a personalised sweater, home for Christmas break. The pictures became further apart as his mother became older— next thing Harry knew, his mother was in a wedding dress, James Potter standing where Severus used to. “... But you can come here whenever you want, and I’ll let you look at it.” 

It was only then that Harry started crying, his tears flowing rapidly now that the dam had been broken. He sniffled and nearly choked himself trying to stop because 

crying meant weakness in Privet Drive

— but Severus never raised his hand, nor did he look angry, like there was an oncoming storm. Instead, the potions master rested a calloused hand on Harry’s head, patting the boy’s fluffy hair gently. Even though such a thing had never happened before, Harry instinctively tucked himself closer to the professor, craving a warmth he had only felt when he was an infant. 

None of his snakes had ever behaved like this, which rendered Severus completely clueless of any proceedings he could follow. Eleven-year-old, tiny little Harry James was cuddled into his side, sniffling and wiping away his snot, trying desperately 

not 

to cry. 

Severus thought of Spinner’s End, of a kitchen lit with one pathetically flickering bulb, and for a brief moment, remembered what a comforting embrace felt like. Slowly, the man wrapped one arm around Harry, pulling the boy closer. It wasn’t much— Severus never had much, just bits and pieces of something that once was, like a video missing half its’ frames. 

But for Harry? 

It was everything.

Rather unsurprisingly, Hermione’s parents knew absolutely 

nothing 

about Flamel. They promised to look up the man through their dental records, but the young witch was certain that their efforts would go to waste. Harry’s letters, co-signed by Theodore, showed no sign of the mystery man, either. The two had spent their winter break combing through whatever unrestricted material the library provided, with no success. In one of their letters, Harry wrote that he had gone up to Madam Pince to inquire about Flamel, but the librarian stiffened up and told him not to pursue the matter any longer. 

It seemed that all the Hogwarts staff knew at least a little about the corridor on the third floor, the slobbering Cerberus, the trapdoor it was guarding. Feeling rather dejected that Professor Snape wouldn’t be awarding her extra marks for her essay, the muggleborn Slytherin slumped in her train compartment, her textbooks looking uninteresting for the first time since she started her studies at Hogwarts. 

“C-Cheer up, Hermione.” said Neville, gently caressing a plant his grandmother had gifted him for getting sorted into Gryffindor. The plant preened under his touch, rubbing its leaves against his palm, asking for more pats. 

The muggleborn had brought him up to date on Flamel, adding and expressing her frustration at not locating the man 

anywhere

. It was as if he existed in a time when written records weren’t a thing yet. “He must be 

somewhere

!” she said, running a hand through her curled locks and grunting when it got stuck. “It’s not as if the records could be wiped clean of him— unless Flamel’s just some sort of codename, or maybe—” 

“Granger!” The compartment door slammed open, and in the doorway stood Draco, his gelled hair looking a little unkempt. The boy’s pale cheeks were flushed red, as if he had just been running. 

“I’m in the middle of a rant, Draco, either sit down or close the door.” said Hermione impatiently. Looking stunned, the blonde flicked his eyes over to Neville, who only laughed lightly and shrugged. Without knowing what else to do, the boy slid the compartment door close and took his seat. “Like I was saying, Flamel’s got to be 

somewhere, 

maybe we’re just not looking at the right place—” 

“Anything off the cart, dears?” interrupted the cart lady with a kind smile on her face. 

“I’ll have a chocolate frog.” piped Neville, digging around his coat. Trevor came out of the coat first, looking very stunned at the sudden brightness as compared to the inside of Neville’s pocket. Pursing his lips, the Gryffindor dug around his pocket a little more, looking more nervous as time dragged on, the cart lady eyeing him. “Um, I may have misplaced…” 

“Here.” said Draco, handing a couple knuts to the cart lady, who in turn handed him a couple boxes of chocolate frogs. “I’ll have a pumpkin pasty too.” 

Flushing red, Neville looked away, afraid that the blonde would ridicule him for losing his money barely a day into the new semester. To his surprise, the snide comment didn’t come. Instead, Draco shoved a chocolate frog in his direction, refusing to meet Neville’s thankful gaze. 

“You should keep a better watch on your money, Longbottom.” said Draco, although not as unkindly as Neville would’ve expected. Dumping the rest of his purchased goods on the seat, the blonde plopped down on the seat, unwrapping his pumpkin pasty. “Mother never lets me have any of these,” he said between dignified chews, “says that I can’t ever be caught eating these.” 

“Lucky for you I don’t have a camera then,” sighed Hermione, as if she was regretting not bringing one. 

The blonde snorted. “Anyway, I can’t have this much chocolate. I have a 

figure 

to preserve. Have some, Granger.” 

Hermione, who rarely had chocolate due to her parents being dentists, was more than happy to dig in. Although she didn’t look comfortable biting into the head of a moving and croaking frog, she did, savouring the melting sugar on her tongue. “It’s so good,” she sighed. 

“You know,” Draco said, wiping his mouth elegantly, “If we really can’t find Flamel, I could write back and ask one of the elves to search Mother’s library. I 

was 

going to ask Mother myself, but she was too busy dragging me from shop to shop to get measurements for my robes. You would 

not 

believe how many winter balls I’ve had to attend—”

“Guys,” said Neville suddenly, looking ecstatic. “I’ve found him!”

The two Slytherins shared a glance. “Found who?” asked Hermione, furrowing her eyebrows. “... If you’re looking for Trevor, he’s—” She gestured to Trevor, who was staring quietly into the eyes of a chocolate frog, unblinking. 

“No!” exclaimed Neville, waving a small chocolate-smeared card in his hands, “Flamel! Nicolas Flamel! I’ve found him!” 

The compartment space was small, so Hermione and Draco collided into each other as they scurried to see what Neville was holding. It was a chocolate frog card— to be specific, it was 

Dumbledore

’s chocolate frog card. 

“1945… Twelve uses of unicorn blood... His work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel!” Hermione read aloud, getting excited. Sparks danced in her eyes as she grinned widely, turning to Draco and Neville. “I think I know where to find Flamel now! Professor’s 

got 

to give me bonus marks on my essay!” 

The muggleborn began to celebrate ecstatically, looking every part a giddy schoolgirl. 

“What bonus marks?” echoed Draco, confused. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Instead of taking the boats across the lake, they were carted through the woods in magically-drawn carriages. Hermione was brimming with energy for the whole ride, much to the confusion of Draco, who still hadn’t figured out what bonus marks Hermione was getting. The sun was just setting as they arrived at Hogwarts, and while most other students went off to their common rooms to greet their friends and wash up before dinner, Hermione dragged Draco and Neville to the library, where she knew Harry and Theodore would be. 

“We found Flamel!” whispered Hermione, as excited as a whisper could be. 

“You did?” Theodore glanced up from 

Greatest 19th Century Wixen Discoveries

. Beside him, Harry looked away from 

History of Quidditch

 before hurriedly shoving it away. Around the two boys were stacks of books, ranging from 

Forgotten Alchemy Breakthroughs 

and 

Achievements of Greatest Wizards

 and 

Barnaby the Kraken-Defeating Wizard

. “Where?” 

“On Dumbledore’s Chocolate Frog card.” said Neville, looking somewhat proud as he held up the said card. 

Before anyone could say anything, Ron Weasley emerged from behind a bookshelf, looking suspicious and triumphant. “Aha!” he said, in an accusing manner, pointing a lanky finger in their direction. “I knew it! You’re all up to something— it’s about Flannel, I bet—” 

“Flamel,” corrected Hermione. 

“— And none of you had the decency to fill me in?” Ron said crossly. “I was there too, you know! I saw the Cerberus, too—” 

“Shh!” hissed Harry, Hermione, and Theodore in unison. Across the library, sitting at her counter, Madam Pince was narrowing her gaze, somehow knowing that the group was up to no good. After all, what would a bunch of snakes and lions be doing, gathered together at the library on the first day after winter break? 

“For Merlin’s sake, lower your voice!” Hermione said, rubbing the bridge of her nose, looking a little haughty. “Madam Pince is a minute away from chasing us out. I think I know where to find Flamel now— the rest of you should leave first, to decrease suspicion. We’ll meet up after dinner in the unused classroom one corridor down from Charms.” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said Draco, at the same time that Ron grumbled: “Yes, Professor Granger.” The moment the words left their mouths, the two stared at each other, jaws gaping, horrified at the fact their thoughts synchronised. 

“Ew!” Ron yelped, scrunching up his nose. 

Making a shooing motion, Hermione chased the boys out of the library, much to Madam Pince’s approval. The young Slytherin shot the librarian a sweet smile as she returned, sporting her most innocent look as she subtly slinked back into the shadows of the shelves, running her fingers along the spines. Thinking hard, Hermione slipped from row to row, her eyes trailing over the titles sharply. When at last her gaze settled on a worn cover, title inscribed in gold, she couldn’t help but let out a small excited squeal. 

Tugging the heavy book out of the shelf, Hermione brushed her hand over the cover, waving the dust away, eyes shining.

“Found you,” she whispered, staring at 

Alchemy, Ancient Art and Science

. 

Seated in his office in the dungeons, glancing through the scored abysmal essays he had to return to the students, Severus sneezed, having a foreboding feeling that he would have to award Ms. Granger extra points on her assignment. He shook his head, looking wry. The Wizarding World would not know what hit them when Hermione Granger was released into the world. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“I’ve found him!” whispered Hermione excitedly as she slipped into the Great Hall, having blended in with the Hufflepuffs coming from the kitchens. Harry gave her a thumbs up while Theodore, across the table, grumbled unhappily, upset that they found Flamel in a 

Chocolate Frog Card

, of all places. 

“Found who?” Daphne perked up, looking interested. 

“It’s a secret,” said Draco, looking smug. His important moment didn’t last very long, as Hermione delivered a loud smack to his head in the next second. “Ow!” he whined, glaring at the muggleborn. “What was that for!” 

Ignoring him, Hermione turned to Daphne with a wink. “I’ll fill you in later.” Slipping onto the bench next to Harry, the brunette urged her friends to eat faster, desperately trying to catch Ron’s eye contact after she cleaned her plate spotless. The Gryffindor, who was engrossed in enjoying his chicken drumstick, made no sign of looking up, much to Hermione’s annoyance. Thankfully, Neville, who eventually felt as if someone was glaring straight at his soul, met Hermione’s gaze and got the memo, nudging the redhead beside him. 

It was incredibly suspicious that four Slytherins and two Gryffindors across the hall got up at 

exactly 

the same time, especially since Ron was pretty well-known for staying until the food was magically cleared away. Luckily for them, Fred and George were snickering with Lee Jordan, probably about nothing good; Gemma Farley was busy catching up with her friends and Caden Seymour was too far down the table to spot the first-years. 

When Hermione saw Ron and Neville heading towards the same exit as them, she hurriedly gestured for them to use the other door to leave the Great Hall, but the two lions mistook her gestures as ‘walk faster’ instead of ‘use the other door’ and so they scurried towards the Slytherins. Theodore and Draco had already ducked behind the archway, out of sight from those in the hall, while Hermione was furiously pointing the other direction and Harry was watching the staff table like a rabbit ready to bolt. 

By some miracle, the lions made it to the exit without any teacher stopping them in their tracks. Hermione opened her mouth to tell the two boys off, but Harry tugged on her sleeve and whispered for her to let it go. 

“Spill the beans!” urged Draco when they were finally settled in the empty classroom Hermione spoke of. The blonde was shaking with anticipation, his eyes blown wide as he stared at the thick book in the muggleborn’s hands. “Come on, Granger!” 

“If you would shut up for two minutes,” snapped Hermione, flipping rapidly through the book after she plopped it heavily onto the table, “I 

would

.” Suddenly, her eyes lit up and focused on a specific page. “There! Found him. Nicolas Flamel,” Hermione recited excitedly, “is the only known maker of the Philosopher’s Stone!” 

Silence fell over the group of first years as they comprehended the information. 

“Sorry, um, what’s the Philosopher’s Stone?” Neville asked meekly. 

Humming, Theodore pursed his lips thoughtfully. “If I’m not mistaken…” he shuffled next to Hermione to get a better view of the text, “... It’s a magical artefact that produces an elixir capable of making someone immortal, given that they drink the elixir before a time period runs out.” 

“Makes sense,” Ron nodded, “who wouldn’t want to steal a stone that granted immor— immortali— er, that made you live forever?” said the redhead after blundering over the word a few times. 

“Immortality.” said Harry helpfully. 

The Weasley flushed and mumbled the word under his breath, sounding it out. “Thanks.” 

“It’s got to be Quirrel.” said Hermione, steering the conversation back in the right direction. “He’s got to be the one aiming for the stone… But 

why

?” 

Ron snorted. “What other reason do you need? That stone grants im… immortality,” he said, looking pleased as he nailed the pronunciation. “Who 

wouldn’t 

want a stone like that?” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Classes started up the day after winter break, with Hogwarts operating at full speed once more after a couple weeks of snowy silence. Students were bustling in the hallways once again, still wrapped up in their scarves until the cold grip finally released its frigid hold on the castle. As one walked through the building, they would be able to hear the voices of the professors, the students practising their spells and the tell-tale explosions that signified a failed attempt. 

Despite his friends’ frosty suspicion of Quirrell, Harry couldn’t help but feel sorry for the man. He had gotten paler and skinnier over the holidays, looking sicker and sicker by each passing day. Figuring that the professor wouldn’t attack him in broad daylight, in the middle of a hallway, Harry approached the man when they passed by him, handing the man a handful of chocolate, explaining that it was leftover from Christmas. 

“You looked like you needed it, sir.” explained Harry shyly, rubbing his arms. “My aunt always gives Dudley chocolates when he’s sad. It makes him feel better.” 

After recovering from his initial shock, Quirrell stammered his reply: “T-T-Thank y-you, Mr. P-P-Potter.” The defence professor jumped slightly when he spotted Hermione, Draco, and Theodore bristling and glowering at him, a few feet from where sunshine-child Harry was, but didn’t say anything and walked away shakily. 

The week after winter break was overall rather uneventful— after all, what could happen to Harry if his friends, his Quidditch teammates (mainly Terrence and Marcus), not to mention Percy and Oliver, were all occasionally glancing over their shoulders to make sure he hadn’t been kidnapped? There was no child in the whole of Hogwarts safer than the emerald-eyed boy. 

Due to the upcoming Slytherin vs. Hufflepuff match, Quidditch practice started up barely a week into classes, with Marcus going head-to-head with the Hufflepuff captain, Suzuka Naoki, both snagging the pitch whenever they could. News was circulating that Hufflepuff had gotten itself a new seeker, three years older than Harry. 

“He’s almost twice your height,” said Terrence kindly, “don’t worry too much about it, though. You’ve probably got half his weight— makes you faster.” 

“The Hufflepuff team isn’t that good anyway,” Marcus snorted, “even if this Diggory guy is half the deal they say he is, the rest of their team sucks. Our chasers, beaters and keeper are more than enough to win us this game.” 

Harry didn’t feel very reassured about this. The rumours had spread like wildfire and the whole school was ablaze, talking about the handsome Hufflepuff seeker that might just be the key to tearing Slytherin off their throne. It wasn’t long before Harry caught his first sight of Diggory, flocked by students sporting all colours but green. 

“Take them down, Cedric!” 

“Show the snakes who’s boss!” 

“You’ve got to win the game next week!” 

Cheers rang out from the crowd as Cedric laughed it off humbly, saying that he would try his best. Tucking his head down, Harry quietly snuck past the group, hoping that he would get by unnoticed. He was small, after all— and he had experience knowing how to be ‘invisible’, from all his years at Privet Drive. 

Despite claiming that the Hufflepuff team wasn’t as good as everyone said, Marcus still drove the team to their limits, starting each practice with stamina training, instructing the players to run laps across the vertical length of the pitch. Harry was breathless by his first lap across and simply couldn’t understand how Damian and Tracey still had energy in them to race each other back across. 

“You’ve got to eat more proteins,” remarked Terrence, patting Harry’s breath. The older boy’s hair was damp, at the edge, with sweat, but otherwise, he looked as if he could still complete another five laps and emerge looking pristine by the end of it. Harry supposed that the older one was used to the type of training, seeing as he had many years of experience on the team. 

“I— I’ll try,” panted Harry, hand pressed on his constricting chest. His lungs felt small all of a sudden, as if something was caging them, preventing them from expanding to their full volume. 

Next, Marcus let the bludgers loose, instructing the beaters— Peregrine (who had told Harry to address him as ‘Perry’) and Adrian to yeet the concussion-giving balls towards Harry, Terrence, Tracey, and Damian. The beaters flew around, swinging with all they could, while the chasers and seekers swerved gracefully through the air, avoiding all the potential infirmary visits. Meanwhile, Marcus short quaffle after quaffle at Miles, who flew around blocking scores while glaring intensely at Harry and Tracey across the pitch. 

After bludger training, Terrence let the Snitch out, and the two seekers begin their long game. They would fly around the pitch, straining their eyes to catch sight of the golden, winged walnut. Below them, the chasers were flying from one end of the pitch to other, dodging bludgers hit by the beaters to score at the other end. 

By the time it was too dark to keep training, Harry was ready to drop dead on the ground. Tracey wasn’t much better, denying the fact she was tired in between yawns. Even though the older years laughed at their juniors’ antics, they too, were slumping and yearning for a warm bath— then bed. 

“Good job, everyone.” Terrence said warmly, lip quirking when Harry slumped over on Tracey’s shoulder, eyes fluttering shut. “Let’s head back.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Anxiety bubbled in Harry’s chest like a potion gone wrong. His sheets felt like they held the weight of the world, pushing down on him, creating crack after crack in his ribcage. Moonlight shone, tinted water-green through the Black Lake, rays dancing across his blanket. All around him, glass windows displayed the vast unknown, curtained by the water surface, and yet, Harry had never felt so claustrophobic. 

Deciding that tossing around was no use, Harry got up, tiptoeing quietly out of the dorm. He threaded softly into the common room, leaving the fireplace unlit. One wall of the common room was replaced by a whole, curved stretch of glass, the edges bordering on kelp and seaweed on the lakebed. Harry stared into the depths of the water, unmoving as the squid waved one of its great tentacles across the window. 

It was no use. 

Somehow, he still felt trapped. He felt as if a mysterious something was closing in on him, like a net, like a cage. Hogwarts at midnight should’ve felt serene, but instead, Harry felt suffocated. 

With the Hufflepuff dawning on him with the rise of the sun, Harry knew he should’ve been in bed, snoring away, storing energy for his match. Something inside his chest stirred, yearned: 


Sky

. 

It was a bad idea right from the start. Harry shook his head, clearing his thoughts. It was stupid to go flying at night— he had never flew at night, by himself, before— plus, if he got injured out there, no one would know, no one would come find him. If he got caught by 

anyone

— anyone at all— Professor Snape would wring his neck. Terrence and Marcus would give him the scolding of his lifetime, and even though he had gotten yelled at before, he knew without a doubt that being lectured by his captain and mentor would hurt more than anything else the Dursleys had ever said to him. 

Because he cared. 

Because he cared about what they thought about him. 

Because he cared, because he wanted them to love him, because 

for once

, there was someone he could make proud. 

Harry stared into the lake again, and his heart yearned once more: 

sky

. 

He took a step. 

And then another. And another. 

“What are you doing?” 

Yelping, Harry jumped a foot into the air. Just before he stepped into the archway that led to the staircases spiralling into the dorms, Caden Seymour emerged from them, narrowing his eyes at the younger boy. 

“... Shouldn’t our seeker be in bed?” questioned the prefect, arms crossed. 

“I— I couldn’t sleep,” stammered Harry, “I… I wanted to go out for a fly, to— to settle my nerves, but I thought— I thought it was a bad idea, c-cause…” He trailed off, afraid to say: 

Professor Snape, Terrence and Marcus would get mad if they found out, and I don’t want them to be mad at me

. 

“A night fly?” Caden raised an eyebrow. “You’re right, that’s a bad idea. If you hurt yourself out there, no one would know. You could be there for 

hours 

before you were found.” 

“... Yeah.” Harry hung his head. 

The prefect sighed. “Can you sleep if you go back now?” 

“P-Probably not.” mumbled Harry. 

Caden contemplated this for a few moments, wearing a worn cotton T-shirt and old sweat pants. “... Well,” he said slowly, “If we’re quick, I suppose it’ll be fine.” 

This caught Harry a bit off guard. He stared at the older Slytherin, uncomprehending. “... What?” 

“I said,” the prefect cleared his throat, embarrassed. “If we go quickly and come back quickly, well— Professor Snape would never have to know. I know a spell to override the protection spells on the broom locker.” 

Harry brightened. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“I’ll wait for you here.” said Caden, casting a few warming charms on Harry’s clothes before he did his own. The younger boy was already holding his Nimbus, practically shaking with excitement. “Not longer than five minutes, you hear me?” 

“Yes, sir!” chirruped Harry, 

The prefect’s stern look dissolved and he nodded for Harry to move along. “Alright.” 

Without waiting for a second beat, Harry tumbled down the path to the pitch, boarding his broom the moment his feet touched the grassy Quidditch ground. He took to the skies, exhilaration pumping in his veins as he soared higher and higher. His heart felt free, released from the net, released from the cage. The invisible chains that had been tying him down were gone, burnt into ashes that floated into the cool air. 

Somewhere in the forest, an owl hooted, swooping in the tree-tops for its nightly hunt. The emerald-eyed boy did a couple loops, flying in and out of the goal posts, skimming along the seats and against the towers lining the court. The wind was singing his name, over and over, 

Harry, Harry, Harry

. He wished he could stay, surrounded by the stars and the half-hidden moon forever and never return to Privet Drive. 

What a dream that would be. 

Feeling that his time was almost up, Harry swooped down, his toes brushing the tip of the grass until he slowed to a stop. His breath was creating small little clouds in the air, his pants the only sound other than the wind in the silent night. 

“Potter!"

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Flying into the pitch, dressed in broomstick-patterned pyjamas and a soft brown coat was none other than Hogwarts’ new star, Cedric Diggory. He landed gracefully, eyeing Harry’s oversized, hand-me-down shirt and the pants so long he had to roll up to prevent tripping over. 

“Out for a night fly, too?” asked the Hufflepuff seeker good-naturedly. 

“Y-Yeah,” said Harry, flushing. Caden wouldn’t be pleased to hear that there was an eye-witness of his little night trip. 

“Flying at night helps my nerves,” Cedric said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’m… Pretty nervous about tomorrow. You were pretty awesome in that Gryffindor match, especially after your broom acted up like that.” 

Embarrassed now, Harry flopped his hair so that it covered his eyes, too shy to look into Cedric’s soft, grey gaze. “T-Thanks.”

“I don’t think I’ve ever properly introduced myself,” said Cedric, extending a friendly hand. “I’m Cedric Diggory.” 

“H-Harry. I’m… Pretty nervous about tomorrow’s match, too.” admitted Harry, running a hand through his fluffy locks. “Um… I don’t want to let down my team.” 

The other seeker laughed, not unkindly. “I probably shouldn’t say this, especially since you’re my opponent tomorrow, but…” Cedric looked half-guilty as he spoke, “The whole school’s counting on me to beat you guys tomorrow, and honestly… All those expectations are driving my nerves up the wall. It’s my first game…” The seeker waved his hands around, frustrated and anxious. “If Hufflepuff wins, that’s great. But if we lose, well, wouldn’t be the first time— but the whole bloody school’s counting on me.” 

“That’s awful,” Harry said, looking apologetic. “I think I’d break under all that pressure. It’s bad enough with my own house counting on me, but with 

three 

houses—” 

“Right!” Cedric nodded in agreement. “But I’m not asking you to go easier on me, though—” added the Hufflepuff quickly, “— I want a fair game. Fair and square. Whoever wins, wins.” 

“Whoever wins, wins,” echoed Harry. 

The two seekers stared at each other for a moment longer, finding a common ground under their anxiety and fear of letting their housemates down— and smiled. A new bridge had begun constructing itself between the two, a badger and a snake shaking hands— er— shaking a paw and a tail— under the star-studded sky. 

“I should probably get going,” said Harry at last. 

Cedric nodded. “See you tomorrow, Potter. Let’s have a good game.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Morning arrived, sweeping the whole school into Quidditch excitement. Students everywhere were sporting the colours of the house they supported— which meant that three-quarters of the school was docked out in honey yellow. By 9am, the entire school had flocked onto the bleachers, the Slytherins looking small in the crowd of Hufflepuff supporters. 

“Ready?” asked Terrence, a supportive hand on Harry’s shoulder. 

The emerald-eyed boy glanced at the crowd outside, hearing the 

Hufflepuff! Hufflepuff! Show em’ you’re tough! 

chant reverberate around the stadium. He thought he’d be nervous— but to his surprise, the rise and surge of the stormy turmoil inside him was strangely absent. Where his anxiety used to loom, a quiet logicality sat. Cedric’s words echoed inside his head: 

“

Let’s have a good game

,” said Harry with a smile, running his gloved palm along the length of his broom, his fingers tracing the words 

Nimbus

. Terrence blinked in surprise, especially when the younger seeker met his eyes with the gaze of a quiet, young stag— one that knew its place in the food chain, one that knew when to fight and when to run. “Ready.” 

Smile growing wider, Terrence nodded approvingly. “Good.” 

Standing back, the seventh year watched proudly as the young stag took to the skies, emerald eyes firm and steady as the youngest seeker of the century took his place among his teammates. Across the pitch, the Puffs had saddled up, their captain flying forward to meet Marcus at the middle. 

“

Slytherin, Slytherin, we’re made to win!

” 

“

Hufflepuff, Hufflepuff, show them you’re tough!

” 

The pitch was aflame with chants, older years casting 

sonorous 

in a battle of volume. 

“I want a 

fair 

game, you hear me?” said Madam Hooch, with a sharp glance at Marcus, who only shrugged nonchalantly. Naoki, the Hufflepuff captain, narrowed his glare at the other, his jaw set fiercely. “Ready? One— Two— Three!” 

“

Here we go, folks

— 

the game that decides the top two houses running for Quidditch cup this year! Slytherin’s Tracey Davis has gotten the Quaffle

— 

damn, she can fly

— 

Davis passes to Flint, and Flint

— 

scores

!” Lee Jordan was commentating again, sounding disappointed as he announced Flint’s goal. “

Come on, play up, Puffs

— 

Suzuka Naoki, Hufflepuff captain

—

 got the Quaffle

— 

oh, just barely avoided that Bludger over there

— 

Lin from Hufflepuff got that

— 

what a swing, the Bludger’s heading straight for

— 

oof!

” 

The commentator grimaced as the Bludger smacked an oblivious Adrian right in the chest, knocking the chaser off his broom. Reacting quickly, Peregrine swerved into a steep dive, catching the chaser two hundred metres before the ground. Madam Hooch blew her whistle sharply, waving her hands to put the game to a stop momentarily. 

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for it to go towards him,” Lin was apologising profusely as the two teams gathered on the grass. “I am so, 

so

, sorry—!” 

“It’s alright, it’s alright,” said Terrence distractedly, tossing his broom aside after flying down from the reserves tower. He brushed Madam Hooch away, squatting down on the floor next to the chaser, who was coughing now. Little specks of blood landed on the boy’s uniform, much to Peregrine’s growing concern. “Adrian, Adrian, can you hear me?” 

Weakly, the fifth-year nodded. 

“You’re going to be fine, you hear me?” Terrence spoke, looking stern. “I’ll bring you to the infirmary. Marcus, call—” 

Before the seeker could finish his sentence, the captain was already directing students to bring in the stretcher onto the field. “On count of three,” said Marcus gruffly, securing his arms around the chaser’s legs. “One, two, three!” 

Adrian was heaved onto the stretcher, coughing harshly after they put him down. Terrence muttered a levitation spell under his breath, holding it steady as he instructed another student to go ahead to inform Madam Pomfrey of the accident. “Damian!” 

The reserve chaser, who had followed Terrence down from the reserve tower, jumped in surprise. He was standing by the stretcher, one hand on it to keep the already-dizzy Adrian from swaying side to side in the wind. 

“You’re playing today,” said the seventh year firmly, flicking his fingers to get one of the students on-hand to take the third-year’s place. “Do your best out there and 

be careful

. We can’t lose a second chaser.” 

Damian blinked once, then twice. “Yes, sir.” He nodded. Glancing at Adrian, who was groaning softly, the younger said: “I’ll do my best.” 

“Good.” Marcus grunted. “I’ll head over to the infirmary after the game.” 

Once Adrian had been safely levitated out of the pitch, the players took to the skies once more, waiting for Madam Hooch’s cue. The whistle pierced the air, and the game was set in motion once more. Lee Jordan recovered from the aftershock of the accident, effectively attracting the audience’s attention back to the on-goings of the pitch. 

“

Here we go again, folks— Flint’s got the Quaffle— underpass to Davis— Davis throws to third-year reserve Damian Evereach— Evereach throws— and keeper Westwood blocks the goal!

” Jordan couldn’t help but do a happy little dance as the Hufflepuff keeper flashed a suave smirk at the reserve chaser, whose head was not entirely in the game yet. At the teachers’ observation tower, Professor McGonagall clapped, grinning when Professor Snape crossed his arms and grumbled incoherently. 

“I know it’s sudden, but get your head in the game!” yelled Marcus over the wind, “You do better than this during training, Evereach!” 

“

Hufflepuff chaser Aurille in position of Quaffle— passes to captain, Suzuka, who passes back— Aurille shoots— AND the Quaffle is intercepted by Davis! Close on, Hufflepuff— smooth throw from Davis to Evereach— Evereach approaches goal, shoots, will he score this time— Westwood dives and misses, Slytherin scores!” 

Lee Jordan sounded dismayed as the Slytherin students cheered, the reserve chaser looking proud and breathless. 

“Nice one, Evereach,” complimented Tracey, grinning. “Do that a few more times and we’ve got this game in the bag.”

High above the pitch, the two seekers were circling the court, like two apex predators of a jungle facing off, eyes sharp and claws flexed, waiting for the other to make the first move. Occasionally, one of them would make a sharp swerve, making the other believe that they had spotted the Snitch— only to reveal that it was fluke. Both seekers were at full attention, their nerves burning with electricity and anticipation, playing a game of 

luck 

and shortest reaction speed. 

Call it coincidence, call it fate— Cedric and Harry glanced down onto the pitch at the same time, both spotting the flash of gold whizzing past Marcus’s ear. No one could say the determinant of the winner was 

luck 

anymore— the two seekers caught sight of the Snitch at the same exact moment. Without missing a second, they pulled into a dive, adrenaline roaring in their ears as their acceleration climbed and their altitudes plummeted. 

“

Both seekers are racing towards the ground

— 

have they seen the Snitch?

” 

Gritting his teeth, Harry pushed his broom harder, hand already outstretched. As if it were panicked, the Snitch changed its course sharply, in a strong attempt to throw the two seekers off. Skidding across the air, the Slytherin seeker curved off smoothly to continue chasing the golden, winged walnut, while Cedric was caught off by the sudden turn. 

“

Slytherin seeker Potter pulls out of a sharp turn smoothly, Hufflepuff’s Diggory left behind

— 

Potter reaches for the Snitch

— 

another sharp turn, the Snitch’s not playing around today

—

 Potter follows the Snitch into the turn, oh no, he turned too fast

—” 

Up in the stands, Draco stood up, panicked, as Harry lost his control of the broom, coming out from his second turn, skidding through the air. Luckily, the Slytherin seeker wasn’t too far off from the ground and tumbled onto the field ungracefully, rolling across the clipped lawn multiple times before stopping. The crowd watched, breaths caught, until Harry lifted himself from the ground, mud, grass, and a wide grin on his face as he announced: 

“I’ve got it!” 

Slytherin burst into thunderous applause— they were now in the running for the Quidditch cup. Not too far behind, the rest of the Slytherin team landed, cheering and ruffling their seeker’s hair— they had won hundred-seventy to zero. One more match against the Ravenclaws and the cup would be theirs, for the eighth year in a row. 

“You go, Harry!” said Peregrine, breathless. The beater gave his hurried congratulations, clapping their young seeker on the back before rushing off the field. Marcus didn’t chastise the fifth-year, even as he ran away, for he knew Peregrine could only think of his injured friend and had been praying for the game to end as fast as possible. 

“Good game.” Marcus cleared his throat, giving Harry a rare, approving smile. “... We’ll be in good hands even after Terrence leaves.” 

“Hey, Potter!” Turning at the sound of the voice, the entire Slytherin team bristled as Cedric, dismounting his broom, approached the group. The Hufflepuff raised his hands, as if in surrender, a friendly smile on his sweat-slicked face. “Good game. You sure were quick on those turns.” 

Harry smiled, reaching out to shake Cedric’s hand. “Good game.” 

Sighing, Naoki stepped up as well, offering a hand to Marcus, who eyed it as if the other would conjure out his wand and hex him on the spot. “Good game, Flint.” And then, “... Are you going to make me stand here forever, Flint?” 

Begrudgingly, Marcus shook the other’s hand, grunting. “... Good game, I guess,” He grumbled. Terrence was typically the one who was… allowed to interact with other houses, as Marcus wasn’t the friendliest representative the snakes could offer, but with the older seeker gone, the captain had no choice. Especially since Harry, their youngest, had already displayed good sportsmanship by shaking hands with Cedric. 

Distracted by the unbelievable show of peace between Marcus and Naoki, no one noticed Dumbledore approach Harry from the back, clasping a hand around the young boy. Before the headmaster could utter a word, the dark-haired boy had leapt away and slotted himself in between Miles and Marcus, two who eyed the headmaster like walking trouble. 

“Excellent game, my boy.” said Dumbledore, in a mysterious, airy voice. This elicited a gaped mouth from every Slytherin within hearing distance— when was the last time the headmaster had congratulated the snakes on something they did? If they didn’t think the man was nuts already, they definitely changed their minds at that point. 

“Indeed. Excellent game, Mr. Potter,” interrupted Professor Snape’s icy voice, brushing past the headmaster. His gaze softened when he met Harry’s emerald eyes, conveying a silent congratulations. “Now, I believe we have a beater in the infirmary, no? Someone should deliver the news of our victory to Mr. Derrick and Mr. Higgs.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“WHAT?” thundered the head of Gryffindor as Severus broke the news to her, calmly sipping on a cup of tea opposite the transfiguration professor. “Albus told me he would be safe there! He said he would be 

loved

!” 

Typically, the two heads of houses only met after a Quidditch game against each other, but Minerva had found Severus’s interruption of the headmaster odd, and questioned him about it. Figuring that it wouldn’t hurt to drop by for tea and subtly flex Slytherin’s win, the potions master agreed, which brought the two to where they were, sitting in the Gryffindor’s office, cups of magically warm tea before them. 

“Well, Albus was 

wrong

,” corrected Severus coldly. “Ten years. Harry Potter was abused, neglected, 

hated 

by his family for 

ten years

. If word of this ever gets out— there will be blood. Trust me— you don’t know how tempting it is for me to 

accidentally 

drop word of this in front of Rita Skeeter, if only to show Albus the severity of his decisions— but muggle hatred would be at an all-time-high, and Harry would hate the attention.” 

Minerva fumed, pacing back and forth between her office. “I saw them!” she stressed, waving her hands around. “I observed them, before Rubeus brought Harry to their doorstep— downright awful, I told him— and he claimed that Harry would be fine, that it would do him good to be raised away from all the uproar—” 

“Mm-hm,” hummed Severus, slowly stirring his tea. 

“— when he could’ve been raised by me, heck, 

you

—” 

“Why 

me

?” 

“— we could’ve raised him properly, let him know that his parents were good wixen, who fought bravely during the war, instead of— what was it you said—” 

“Drunkards,” supplied the potions professor helpfully. 

“Drunkards!” Minerva yelled angrily, sparks of amber magic dancing in the air at her fury. “James and Lily Potter, drunkards! Nonsense! A whole load of bullshit!” 

“I agree,” Severus nodded. 

At last, the transfiguration professor slumped down in her seat, head in her hands. “Merlin, he looked so 

tiny 

when I first saw him,” she whispered, heartbroken. “They starved him.”

“That they did.” 

“If only I checked on him,” Minerva sighed, squeezing her eyes shut. “I wanted to— Albus told me that he was fine, that the Dursleys wouldn’t want me prying around— Merlin, why did I listen to him…” 

“Why does anyone listen to him, really? said Severus dryly, fiddling with his stirrer absent-mindedly. “He even had the nerve to call Harry ‘my boy’ after the match, when he hadn't bothered to check up on him after dumping him on that miserable hag’s doorstep.” 

“Does— Does anyone else know?” asked Minerva, her greying hair falling out in strands from her typically neat bun. “That they treated Harry like— like—” 

“As of currently,” Severus said thoughtfully, “Poppy knows. She found out first, when Harry completely disassociated after Longbottom’s potion accident. Terrence and Marcus know, too— they’ve been monitoring his diet under the excuse of building him up for Quidditch. I’d say a couple of the… brighter seniors might’ve caught wind of it, too, by seeing the little signs here and there.” 

“Good lord,” muttered Minerva, shaking her head. “I should’ve noticed sooner…” 

“We all should’ve,” said Severus, “... Especially me. It’s not uncommon for cases to occur in my students, but I never thought that Harry, of all people, would be one of them. I… let my prejudice get in the way,” admitted the Slytherin, “I assumed he would’ve grown up like his father and I let that blind me.” 

Reaching across the table, Minerva clasped her hand around Severus’s comfortingly. “You can make it up to him.” she said, softly. “I didn’t notice it before, but he 

trusts 

you, Severus. Back there, on the pitch— when Albus congratulated him, he looked wary, stiff— but when you congratulated him? He looked like you had just given him the whole world.” 

Severus was quiet for a moment. “I’ve considered it. Briefly.” 

“Considered what?” Minerva furrowed her eyebrows, confused. 

“... Taking him in,” said Severus hesitantly. “I would rather fight Albus than let Harry go back to that old hag in the summer. They hated him even before they knew for sure he was a magical child— Merlin knows what they’ll do to him after he’s confirmed a— in their words— a 

freak

.” The Slytherin professor groaned, pressing his face into his hands. “By Circe, everything would’ve been so much easier if he ended up Gryffindor.” 

Minerva snorted. “As much as I would’ve loved that, the hat made him one of 

yours

. No changing that now.” 

“I know!” stressed the potions master. “He was supposed to be Albus’s golden child, and now he’s 

not

. As much as getting in the way of Albus’s plans pleases me— it also means that the entire wizarding community has a preset prejudice against him. And given the large percentage of former Slytherins that used to follow the Dark Lord’s footsteps, Harry’s hated by pretty much 

everyone

.” 

The Gryffindor grimaced. “You’ve got a point there.” 

“There are still rumours of me being a former Death Eater.” Severus continued. “If word gets out that Harry’s with me, there’ll either be an uproar about Harry’s safety, or an uproar about how the boy-who-lived is now turning to the dark side. On top of that,” said the potions professor, as if things couldn’t possibly get worse, “The other Death Eaters will start questioning my loyalty, and when the Dark Lord comes back— we both know that’s inevitable— he’ll either kill me or demand for me to bring Harry to him. It’s a lose-lose situation.” 

The two sat in silence, tea now untouched. 

“I don’t want to lose another one, Minerva.” said Severus softly. “It hasn’t even been six months since Morgan. Terrence… he’s been strong, he tries not to show it, but he’s still mourning.” 

The potions master stared out of the window, remembering the reason only one seventh-year prefect existed. Either by magic, a trick of light, or fatigue, Severus glimpsed the reflection of a young girl, bright eyes and equally bright smile beaming at him, a greeting dancing across her lips— 

good morning, professor!

 

“We all are.”

Notes:

So much of this chapter wasn't planned— in my notes, I only wrote 'Slytherin vs. Hufflepuff match' and that's about it. No Cedric, no Adrian getting injured, nada.The addition of the whole Morgan ordeal was also an impulsive(ish) decision. I knew from the beginning that Terrence was going to have a small, tragic arc of his own, but I didn't plan exactly where to insert it. Guess we're going to do that now... I'll just see where inspiration takes me.Let me just say that I adore Terrence with all my heart— and that is why I'm going to drag him through a hella lot of pain. Tragic backstory time :D !!EDIT (10/04/2024): STRAWBERRY TART: Terrence & Morgan's Story ToldEdit: I just got a couple mean comments from an anon, and this isn't the first time it's happened, so let me just. Clarify. Yes, when I first see your comment, I get a bit sad, cause I usually get excited to see comments on this fic. BUT! I have worked out a mechanism. See, I have a really really really short term memory. So, if I delete all your mean comments the day I see them, I usually forget about them by like, the next hour. If you really want to waste your time writing these useless messages, know that I do not give a fuck, I am shameless, and I have a short memory. :3







Chapter 19: Does Hogwarts Offer Fire Insurance?

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Severus shouldn’t be surprised. Ever since he set up the dropbox outside his office, Hermione Granger had been taking 

full 

advantage of it to leave letters— dated on different days— with whole 

pages 

of detailed inquiries. This time, she had left… A quick count told him 

fifteen

, plus one letter from one of his NEWT-taking Slytherins. Just before he headed back inside his office, to begin penning his answers to Ms. Granger— he spotted a slip of paper, taped to the inner roof of the box. 

Suspicious, Severus ran detection spells over it, and only once the result turned out negative did he pluck the small piece of parchment from the dropbox. It seemed that all his precautions were unneeded, as he unfolded the letter, revealing two words from an anonymous sender: 

Philosopher’s Stone

. 

Smirk tracing his lips, the potions master made a mental note to award the first-year muggleborn additional marks on her essay. Perhaps he would throw in a couple for Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, and Mr. Nott, as well— there was no doubt that the other three were involved in one manner or the other, especially with how often Harry and Theodore had been frequenting the library through the winter holidays.

Flicking his wand to absent-mindedly check the secureness of his protection spells, the Slytherin professor retreated into his office for an evening of quiet essay marking— an evening of headache, of dragging his eyes over the poorly-literated nonsense many students were turning in. Briefly, Severus glanced up from the stack of migraines to wonder if his snakes were getting up to no good— now that they knew what lay under the Cerberus, surely they wouldn’t be dumb enough to venture further to satisfy some stupid, eleven-year-old curiousity? 

Thankfully, Severus’s first-year snakes were, in fact, working studiously in the library, as Hermione had realised the exams were a month away, and insisted that they begin their revision as soon as possible. Harry, determined to do well in his exams, agreed instantly. Draco, refusing to let a muggleborn and a halfblood outdo him in the finals, had no choice but to tag along. Theodore thought it would be amusing to watch Draco fidget restlessly— plus, he could get in some additional, irrelevant research done. And so, the four snakes set off for the library, booking a table with a peaceful view of the sunset. 

“I told you they’d be here!” 

The four snakes glanced up from their work to see Ron, triumphantly leading Neville to their table. 

“Hi,” waved Neville shyly, carrying a stack of books. “Um… The exams are coming up, and… I really don’t want to fail Potions. I was… Hoping I could get some pointers, and… Ron said you’d be here.” 

“Come sit!” welcomed Hermione warmly, although she made sure to keep her voice low. 

Neville happily got settled in, surrounded by the group of first-year potions’ top-scorers. “Come on, Ron.” said the Gryffindor, handing his potions essay to Hermione, who was already scanning the parchment for improvements. “You know you need help, too.” 

“Fine.” Ron, who had been standing awkwardly by the side, grumbled, pulling out a chair next to Theodore, who was casually browsing a book on Nordic runes. “... Snape’s going to fail me anyway, he hates me.”

“Yes, he does.” commented Draco idly, taking Neville’s essay from Hermione, a list of criticisms already forming in his little blonde head. “Doesn’t help that you’re abysmal at potions to begin with, 

Weasley

.” 

“Well, sorry we can’t all be Snape’s godson, 

Malfoy

.” bit Ron back. “Merlin knows the only reason you’re passing his class is cause he favours you.” 

“Oh, don’t be fooled.” Theodore cut in dryly, “Professor might not scold us in front of you lions, but he sure takes his sweet time chewing us out when you’re out of sight. Slytherins are prideful, you know. Professor would never let us lose face in front of the Gryffindors.” 

“If the two of you are done continuing your blood feud or whatever, some of us are trying to study.” interrupted Hermione, replicating Professor McGonagall’s stern look. “If you’d like to continue, take it into the corridors and leave the rest of us in peace.” 

“I didn’t start it.” said Draco smoothly. “Longbottom, I can’t fathom how you keep messing up the terminology when the textbook gives you a whole vocab list to refer to. You’ve also somehow swapped all the clockwises’ and counter-clockwises’ in your essay, which is honestly astounding given how you could’ve copied all of this from the textbook.” 

“Oh, Neville, when Draco’s done with your essay could you test me on Herbology?” piped up Harry, nose-deep in his textbook. “I’m halfway through memorising the characteristics of angiosperms.”

Ron looked horrified at the idea of memorising things for the exam. “Wait, is that coming out?” 

“Sure is.” Theodore hummed, scribbling some runes on another of his notebooks. The boy seemed to have an infinite supply of them. “Sprout mentioned that characteristics were coming out in the written portion of the exam.” 

Scrambling out of his seat, the redhead perched next to Harry, who moved his seat to give space. Quietly, the Slytherin started giving tips and pointers on what the Herbology professor had subtly hinted for them to study more of. Ron was overly dazed by the sudden inflow of information, but listened anyway. Across the two, Draco was still criticising Neville’s essay dryly, Hermione adding in suggestions to correct the mistakes. 

An hour or so had passed when the group noticed Hagrid tip-toeing into the library. Not that his tip-toeing was very effective, of course, given his size, but no one would tell the half-giant that. He kept glancing around shiftily, his beard swaying and occasionally getting caught between the books when he moved. It was as if Hagrid was playing a part in a comedy spy film. 

“Hagrid in the library. A sight I never thought I’d see.” snorted Draco. “Didn’t know he could read.” 

Hermione was about to shoot a glare towards the blonde’s direction, but seeing as how he was (kinda) helping Neville with his essay, and was sitting at the same table as Ron without having exchanged more than the initial two lines bickering, the brunette thought she could give him some slack. To his credit, Draco’s meanness had simmered down quite a bit since the first few weeks of their schooling at Hogwarts. 

“What’s he looking for?” asked Ron, desperate for any distraction from Herbology. 

“That should be the dragon section, I think.” supplied Theodore interestedly. 

“I have the feeling that this isn’t going to be good.” muttered Harry under his breath. One hour— one hour of studying was all he got without any incident. He had come to Hogwarts expecting many, serene hours of engrossing himself in the bank of knowledge, and was given days of accidentally running into trouble— or getting dragged into trouble because of his friends’ overwhelming curiosity and tendency to poke their noses into things. 

“Why would Hagrid be surfing through the dragon section?” Hermione narrowed her eyes, interest already peaking. The muggleborn pretended not to hear Harry’s grumble of ‘Here we go again’ in favour of staring at the half-giant, who was ignorant of the first-years’ growing investment in his suspicious activities. 

“How about 

that’s none of our business

?” suggested Harry, but his suggestion went unheard. 

Half an hour later, the group was traipsing down the meadows, exchanging theories on Hagrid’s library visit. Spring was crawling back into Hogwarts in the form of grass blades between tiles, green returning to the dried vines, flower buds slowly poking their heads out from the soils. Sparrows frolicked above them, breezy wind combing through their feathers as they sang the tunes of freedom, the songs of the sky above. 

“Maybe,” Hermione said seriously, “He’s thinking of publishing a book about dragons.” 

“Him? Publishing a book?” Draco guffawed. “Keep it realistic, Hermione.” The blonde was too preoccupied to notice his usage of the muggleborn’s first name, but Harry, Hermione, and Theodore had noticed that the boy had been addressing her in that manner more and more often. 

“Or,” Theodore hummed, “He’s thinking of raising a dragon.” 

“That’s a 

horrible 

idea.” said Harry, as if he were about to proclaim that the half-giant would have more sense. “It’s so dangerous! Hagrid wouldn’t— well,” On second consideration, the emerald-eyed boy reworded his sentence. “Dumbledore wouldn’t let Hagrid have a dragon on premises, would he?” 

“There’s a Cerberus on the third floor,” Theodore pointed out. “I wouldn’t put it past ol’ Dumbles.” 

“Nott has a point.” agreed Ron. “Or, Dumbledore 

doesn’t 

know that Hagrid’s planning to raise a dragon in his hut.” 

“Professor Dumbledore will find out, sooner or later,” said Neville timidly. He hadn’t been keen on visiting Hagrid’s hut, especially with the whole dragon matter hanging over their heads, but he and Harry had been outvoted by everyone else. “Can’t be easy keeping a dragon hidden, right?” 

Theodore considered this. “Maybe,” he said slowly, “Hagrid hasn’t thought that far.” 

“And 

maybe

,” Harry cleared his throat, “This is all just a theory, and Hagrid is just reading up on dragons because he likes dragons.” 

As Harry finished, the group came to a stop, standing outside the wooden hut that the gamekeeper used as his residence. All the windows had been covered up by various, mismatched cloths of different colours, and there was a steady column of dark smoke rising from the chimney. Even a few feet away from the hut, the group of students could feel the heat radiating off from the building. 

“Maybe,” suggested Harry slowly, “There was a recent sale of curtains.” 

“As if,” said Hermione, already stepping towards the front door. “You guys coming?” 

“Only to see if that oaf’s really trying to raise a dragon in there.” said Draco eagerly. Theodore nodded in agreement, following after his housemates. Ron was hesitant, but mustered up a chestful of Gryffindor courage and stomped after the three, leaving Neville and Harry in the dust. 

“This is a terrible idea.” muttered Harry. “Just so I can say ‘I told you so’ later.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Hagrid,” said Harry, enunciating each syllable as if he were talking to a baby, “You live in a 

wooden 

house. 

Woo-den

. 

Wooden house

.”

As wild as it was, Theodore had guessed right. Sitting in a cauldron over the fire was a dragon egg, shell glistening as if it were white-hot. If they squinted, the first-years could catch the silhouette of a large lizard-like creature, head tucked in between its arms. The whole hut burned like the inside of an oven, the cakes that Hagrid kept in his cupboards melting and dripping onto the plate. 

Hermione stared at the egg, as if she hadn’t decided if she wanted to be excited about seeing one in person, or if she wanted to be worried about the fact Hagrid lived in a 

wooden house

. Neville shared the same sentiments, and was currently seated as far as physically possible from the fire without being outside the hut. 

“How much did it cost?” asked Draco, eyes gleaming. Hermione rolled her eyes at that— of course Draco’s first concern was the price. “And where did you get it?” 

“Won it las’ night,” Hagrid said, puffing up his chest proudly. “Was at the village las’ night and won a game o’ cards with a stranger. Gave it to meh’— he seemed pretty glad to hav’ it off his hands, ter be honest.” In fact, he was so proud that he didn’t even mind revealing all this information to the son of Lucius Malfoy, who had a strong history of trying to get the gamekeeper fired. 

“Interesting…” hummed Draco, as if he were already thinking of asking his father to buy one for him. “I say, though, isn’t it odd for someone to be walking around town carrying a dragon egg?” 

“Maybe they were already thinking of getting rid of it.” Ron shrugged. “All they’d have to do was to walk around and wait for someone to ask them about it.” 

This attracted Hermione’s attention. “I get what you two are saying, but,” she narrowed her eyes at Hagrid. “Isn’t it very coincidental that someone just 

happened 

to be walking around with a dragon egg? If you really wanted to get rid of it, I’m sure there are other methods— selling it to a dragon sanctuary, auctioning it, maybe— but why 

walk around with it

?” 

“It’s a Norwegian Ridgeback, by the way.” commented Theodore out of nowhere, squatted by the fire. “These grow pretty fast. One month after it hatches, it’ll be about half the size of your hut, Hagrid.” 

Even though the half-giant had absolutely no idea who Theodore was or why he was in his hut, the dark-haired Slytherin boy seemed to know his fair share about dragons, and in Hagrid’s books, that made Theodore an automatic friend. “I jus’ can’t wait ter see him.” said the half-giant tearily. “He’s going ter be such a pretty boy.” 

“You don’t know for sure it’s a male until it hatches.” Theodore corrected. “Although, by the egg size I would guess that it’s a female. Can’t be sure, though.” 

“It’s getting late,” said Harry, “We should get back before we hit curfew. Also, Hagrid, random question— does Hogwarts offer fire insurance, by any chance?” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Hermione was still suspicious about Hagrid’s means of obtaining the dragon egg, and if Harry wasn’t so frazzled over the fact Hogwarts 

didn’t 

offer fire insurance (to be fair, majority of the castle was stone, and also, there were plenty of staff equipped with a good 

aguamenti

), he would mull over the matter with his muggleborn friend. Through the week, Theodore had checked out a couple more books on raising dragons, and was very happily feeding them facts on how long they had before the dragon either outgrew the hut or had the ability to burn it down with one sneeze. 

The next day at breakfast, Hedwig swooped into the hall, landing on Harry’s outstretched arm. The snowy owl preened happily and welcomed the boy’s soft pets, hooting insistently when Harry stopped stroking her feathers. Sure, she had settled in nicely in the owlery, with plenty of other feather friends to keep her company, but nothing could beat Harry’s soothing voice and gentle touch. 

“Oh, no.” Harry’s face fell when he at last read the letter Hedwig had brought him. He passed the letter to Hermione, who passed it to Draco, then Theodore. Each of the Slytherins had varying reactions to the message— from concerned to excited. Regardless, it was decided that the first order of business— once classes were over, of course, for Harry blatantly refused to jeopardise his education any more than necessary— was to visit Hagrid’s hut. 

“Meet in the courtyard at 3pm.” said Harry under his breath as he scribbled an additional remark under Hagrid’s handwriting, Hedwig picking up the note to transfer it over to the Gryffindor table, where Neville intercepted it. The pureblood lion looked constipated at the idea, but handed the note to Ron, who looked equal parts terrified and curious. A quick nod assured Harry that their enemies— er, rivals— kinda friends— had received the intended message. 

If they were all being honest, none of the six students could pay much attention to their classes, despite how interesting Professor Flitwick’s lecture on 

lumos 

was. Even Hermione, who was known for her one-track-mind when it came to classes, was fidgeting with her quill in between jotting notes.

When at last they were released from their last classes, the first-years wasted no time dashing across the castle to meet in the courtyard. Still equipped with their bookbags, the six students ventured off over the rolling meadows towards Hagrid’s hut, a thick, wavy streak of black smoke drifting into the breezy afternoon. 

“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful semester.” mumbled Harry. 

When Hagrid opened the door, the first-years were blasted with a facefull of concentrated heat. In fact, it was so hot that Harry was convinced that if he cracked an egg on the floor, it would be cooked by the next minute. “Oh, it’s out, it’s out!” announced the half-giant, like an overly-excited nurse after childbirth. “He’s 

beautiful

, oh, wait a min’—” There were several crashing sounds behind the door, followed by a distinct, pained yowl from Fang, who scrambled out of the door to sit in the garden shortly after. 

“I want to go home.” murmured Neville, who never asked to be dragged into the mess but was brought along anyway, since Ron didn’t want to be the only lion in the group. 

“Come on in,” said Hagrid merrily, reappearing in the doorway, part of his beard torn away. 

Upon hearing a couple more crashes, hesitancy settled into the first years. There was a living, breathing baby dragon inside the hut, wrecking havoc and raising hell inside an enclosed space. After a few exchanged glances, Ron stepped up bravely, gulping heavily as he took the first step into the hut. Following after him were Hermione, Harry, Theodore, then Draco and Neville, hiding behind the rest. 

“Say hi, Norbert!” encouraged the half-giant. ‘Norbert’ was a baby dragon the size of an adult dog, although it wasn’t nearly as big as Fang yet. Harry thought it rather looked like a crumpled, black umbrella that had just been tossed through a hurricane. 

Norbert garbled nonsense at them before proceeding to latch onto one of Hagrid’s new curtains, ripping it off the window when he decided to prance onto the dining table instead. Sunlight threw itself all over the room, the only source of light in the otherwise dark hut. Hastily, the half-giant searched for something to cover the window, toppling a couple buckets of chicken blood and brandy in his hurry. 

“Merlin help us all,” prayed Neville. He could not have spoken sooner, as Norbert launched himself towards the group, suddenly interested in the first years who had invaded its territory. Slowly, the first years tried their best to back away, Hagrid’s yells of: “He’s harmless, don’t move!” falling to their deaf ears. 

“Granger!” Draco yelled at the muggleborn, who had froze when she saw the dragon’s beady eyes fixate on her. Without thinking, the blonde leapt towards her, the two crashing into the ground as Norbert pounced and collided into the wall behind. Scrambling to his feet, Draco pulled Hermione to hers and they darted across the room, where the rest of their friends were. 

“

Skjold.

” whispered the dark-haired boy, a Nordic rune tracing itself into the air. Instantly, a translucent, white orb surrounded the first-years behind Theodore, Norbert leaping towards them and bouncing off the conjured shield harmlessly. Garbling in confusion, the dragon whipped his head around between the group, gathered behind the shield, and Hagrid, desperately trying to patch up his window. 

Eyeing the shield curiously, Norbert raised one claw, tapping the translucent orb, delighted when Theodore’s norse magic rippled like a glowing, white pond. To their horror, the baby dragon began playing with the shield, making noises of what they assumed to be amusement.

“Anyone have a Plan B, maybe?” grunted Theodore, sweating from the effort. His shield was flickering questionably and wouldn’t last much longer under Norbert’s playful claws. 

“Nobody panic, don’t run, he’s harmless!” yelled Hagrid from the other side of the room, although it was very difficult to take his message seriously when a baby dragon with a jaw large enough to chomp down on any of the first years’ arms was right in front of them. “He’s harmless!” 

“

Someone 

do something!” roared Draco, terrified. “I’m the only Malfoy heir! 

I 

can’t die!” 

“Nice to know at least Malfoy still has his priorities straight!” yelled Ron. 

“You’ve got seven brothers!” hissed Draco in retaliation. Even in the face of death by a curious baby dragon, the two were insistent on keeping the blood feud in continuation. “Your parents won’t even notice if you’re gone!” 

Just before Norbert delivered the killing blow onto the Norse protection, Hagrid— who had ditched putting up the curtains to stumble over the empty buckets in his hut— found a piece of half-mauled chicken, deep wounds tearing through the meat. If it weren’t for the crooked, wing-like limbs at the side, no one would’ve known it was ever a chicken in the first place. 

“Norbert!” Hagrid waved the mauled chicken like a flag, flinging blood everywhere across the hut. “Who wants some chicken, eh? You want some chicken?” 

Excited at the prospect of food, Norbert bounded over, sending books and furniture toppling as he grappled his way across. Theodore, who had clearly never pulled such an impressive shield stunt before, stood shakily on his legs, Ron catching him moments before he fell, weak, onto the ground. 

“Thanks.” mumbled Theodore, slumped over in Ron’s grasp. “I should practice more before I try that again.” 

Widening its large, still toothless jaw, Norbert gobbled the chicken whole, bones cracking in the baby dragon’s mouth as he smushed his food. For a moment— and only 

one 

moment— everyone let out a breath of relief. Unfortunately for them, Norbert was not so easily distracted. Gulping down chunks of meat and broken bone, the newly-hatched baby turned its reptilian eyes on the first years once more, and this time Theodore was too drained to even try. 

“Norbert,” Harry swallowed, a hand extended towards the creature as it slowly moved towards them, a predator with an unblinking, unmoving gaze, a hunter with a one-track mind, a one-track target. “Norbert, down.” 

Despite Harry’s shaky words, the dragon didn’t cease in its approach, instead maintaining eye contact with the green-gazed boy, as if taunting him. The reptile moved, a born killer, putting one claw after another, the clack of its razor-sharp murder weapons ringing against the wooden floor. It was almost as if the dragon was testing Harry, seeing how far it could get, how far it could push until the snap, the crack, the break of the dam. And then, as if someone had just flicked a switch, Norbert stilled completely— so much that they almost thought it had been a dream.

The muscles in the dragon’s leg rippled, unnervingly slow. 

No one breathed. 

Norbert pounced.

Notes:

Was going to write more but as I was writing I saw the opportunity to put a cliffhanger and took it. :P Chillax, it's not like I'll hurt my main babies anyway. I believe that emotional damage is the best damage and Terrence is going under a LOT of that right now so :3

“

Down

!” Harry hissed angrily, standing protectively in front of his friends, giving his sharpest glare to the dragon, who was so shocked that it fell out of the air mid-jump. “

Bad dragon! Bad, bad Nor—

” The boy hesitated, “

— dragon

.” 

Whimpering, Norbert slumped onto the ground, plopping his head in between his scaled paws. It stared forlornly at Harry, who was still looking sternly at the reptile. 

“

Oh no, don’t go thinking you’re very cute by doing that

,” Harry huffed, crossing his arms. “

You’re a bad, bad dragon

.” 

Norbert whined apologetically, flattening itself pitifully against the floor. 

“... Harry,” Hermione spoke up, staring at the boy like he had just grown a second head. “... What was that?” 

“I just… Scolded him.” said Harry, feeling embarrassed. Now that he thought about it, throwing himself in front of his friends before a lunging dragon was probably not his best idea to date, but he had acted in the moment and it was the first thing he thought to do. 

“... In what language?” Ron blurted, looking wild and impressed. “You just… Hissed at it and it just. Stopped.” 

Scrunching his eyebrows in confusion, Harry blinked at his friends. “What do you mean… 

Hissed

?”

“You hissed at it.” Draco said, trying not to look excited. He wasn’t doing a very good job, however, as he was on the verge of ventilating and asking for Harry’s autograph. “I didn’t think they were real— Harry, you’re a 

parselmouth

!” 

It seemed that Draco had wanted this reveal to be very dramatic, as he threw his arms up exaggeratedly and paused, waiting for the echoes of gasp from his fellow first years. Instead, everyone simply stared at him, befuddled, awkward silence hanging in the air. 

“A… What?” Harry cleared his throat. 

“A parselmouth…” Hermione murmured, tapping her chin. “Oh! I’ve read this before, in 

Notable Figures of Wizarding History

— Salazar Slytherin, one of the four Hogwarts founders, was a parselmouth—” Seeing Harry, Ron, and Neville’s faces of confusion, she explained :“— people who can talk to snakes— and so was…” The muggleborn trailed off abruptly, a heavy feeling, heavier than the weight of the world, sunk down onto the girl’s shoulders as the facts fully settled in. 

“The Dark Lord!” Draco finished for her, unaware when Harry flinched. “Father 

has 

to hear about this, he’ll be so pleased that I’m friends with a parselmouth! In fact, Harry, you could even be a descendant of Salazar, or the Dark Lord himself—” 

Before he could cause any further damage, Ron nudged the blonde, giving him a sharp look when Draco turned to make a snappy remark. Only then did it dawn on the Malfoy heir that Harry was shifting uncomfortably from one leg to another, staring at his shoes like he had never seen them before. 

“Oh.” said the blonde softly. “... I… Forgot.” 

“It’s okay.” Harry said, giving his friend a cheery smile. “That… Explains a lot, actually. Does Sssam talk to any of you?” 

“... Who?” Hermione blinked.

“Sssam,” said Harry, as if proclaiming the sky was blue, “The snake at our common room door. The one who asks for passwords.” 

“Let me get this straight,” the muggleborn stressed, looking both astounded and excited at the same time, “The silver snake on our common room door is called 

Sam 

and it talks to you.” 

“Well, it talks to all of us,” Harry corrected, “It hisses 

password 

at us when we’re going in, and sometimes it says 

farewell

 when we’re leaving.” 

“You 

have 

got to teach us how to speak 

snake 

sometime,” slurred Theodore. He was still half-slumped over Ron, who grunted and hefted him up to prevent the Slytherin from sliding onto the floor like boneless slime. “We should… write a dictionary… or something…” 

“I,” panted Ron, who was strong for his age but not strong enough to support Theodore, who was just as lanky as him, for long periods of time. “Will put him on the… couch.” The redhead eyed Norbert, who was still whining pitifully and begging for Harry’s forgiveness. “... That should be fine… right?”

“He’s harmless,” The half-giant decided to enter himself back into the conversation at this point, “He— Heh was jus’ excited, that’ all…” 

“I nearly 

died

,” proclaimed Draco, clutching his chest overdramatically. “

Harmless

 and that… 

thing 

do not belong in the same sentence.” 

Hagrid bit his lip— well, he bit his beard, which was covering his lip— looking nervous. “Norbert… he’s jus’... he’s jus’ a babe…” 

“This may be irrelevant but that’s a 

Norberta

, not a 

Norbert

.” provided Ron helpfully, still helping Theodore move his limp limbs over the couch. “Her snout is long, her scales are quite shiny, and her hip bones are too wide for her to be a 

Norbert

.” 

“Can verify,” said Theodore, sounding a little drunk, “That is indeed, a 

Norberta

.” 

“What?” Noticing that Hermione was staring at him with a befuddled expression, Ron turned away, his already-flushed cheeks (from the heat radiating off the walls) flushed even redder. 

“I… didn’t know that you knew about dragons.” Hermione looked impressed, looking at the redhead in a completely new light— as if she was truly seeing him for who he was for the first time. 

“I… well,” The Gryffindor scratched his neck, awkward but enjoying the spotlight. “My older brother, Charlie— he’s a dragon maniac. Loves them. Has tons and tons of books about them. He’s working in a dragon sanctuary now, in Romania. When I was young, he used to spout random dragon facts, at the dinner table, while we were out chasing the garden gnomes, cleaning the shed— I just picked up a few things over the years, I guess.” 

“Anyhow,” interrupted Neville meekly, his eyes focused on Norber

ta

 and her wagging tail, which was smacking the coffee table and making the plates rattle. “It’s really not a good idea to keep Norbert— er, 

Norberta

— here, Hagrid.” 

“Like Theodore said, in a month's time, Norberta is going to outgrow your 

house

, Hagrid.” Hermione added factually, although upon seeing the half-giant begin to tear-up, she added a little more sympathy into her tone. “

Hagrid

. If anyone finds out, you’re going to be in 

big 

trouble. There’ll be a huge scandal— you don’t want to cause Professor Dumbledore any trouble, do you?”

If anyone had doubts about Hermione being a Slytherin, the doubts were erased right there and then. 

Ron chipped in his two knuts in support. “Plus, 

Norberta

’s been here for a grand total of 

a day

 and Fang’s already getting abused.”

“B-But,” The first years grimaced as Hagrid yanked one of the curtains off the wall, sneezing loudly into it. “He’s just a babe! W-Where’ll he go?” The gamekeeper wailed mournfully, staring at Norberta, who was still relentlessly begging for Harry’s forgiveness. 

“Charlie.” Ron supplied instantly, “I’ll write him a letter, we can pass Norberta to him somehow. She’ll get all the nutrients she needs at the sanctuary, she’ll have plenty of wingroom— think about it, Hagrid. If she stays here, she’ll never get to fly outside, or play with other dragons. At the sanctuary, she’ll be 

happy

.” 

“I think that’s a great idea.” nodded Neville. “And, you won’t have to worry about getting fire insurance.” 

“Or medical insurance. For Fang.” Hermione pointed out dryly. 

The half-giant sneezed into his curtain again. 

“Can’t we keep Norberta for just a little longer, though?” pleaded Theodore, staring at the dragon longingly. “Think about it— how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon 

this 

close?” 

“You almost died.” snorted Draco. “Nott, get your priorities straight.”

“Succeeding my family tree isn’t my main concern, Draco.” 

“Like I said, get your priorities straight.” 

“As much as I hate it,” Hermione sighed, “I have to agree with Draco. Ron, how long will it take for Charlie to reply to us?” 

“If I have to use Percy’s owl, perhaps a week.” Ron said thoughtfully. “Hermes is always flying 

everywhere

— I think he’s off in London getting Oliver’s weekly Quidditch magazine subscription.” 

“We can get Hedwig to deliver the letter.” offered Harry. He had finally given in to Norberta’s pitiful whining, and was gently stroking the reptile's back, running his fingers over the newly-formed scales. Rather like a cat, Norberta was purring happily in the green-eyed boy’s lap, small puffs of smoke puffing from her nostrils in delight. “Although she’s never been to Romania… will she get lost?” 

“Owls have a natural sense of direction.” Ron explained, “Not to mention Wixen-bred owls. They’re much more intelligent than wild ones. Trust me, Hedwig could fly to China if you asked her to.” The redhead paused. “Although she might have to make a couple stops. Wixen-bred or not, they still need sleep and rest.” 

From the way Hermione was looking at the Gryffindor, she was starting to like him a lot more. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“So how do I say ‘Good morning, how are you?’ in parseltongue?” Theodore pursed his lips, quill held steady and ready in his hand, one of his many, many notebooks on the table. Across him, Hermione was also tense with attention, eyes bright with curiosity. 

“

Morning

,” hissed Harry, “Er,” he paused, “I don’t think there’s a translation for ‘how are you’. Snakes don’t really do niceties.” 

“Interesting, interesting,” hummed Theodore, scribbling down across his notebook, alphabets and arrows as he jotted down little remarks on the page margins. “What about… ‘stop’?” 

“

Ssstop

.” Harry provided. “Snakes really like dragging the ‘s’ in their words.” 

Hermione nodded. “Makes sense.” 

“How about… ‘what would you like to eat today?’” asked Theodore, firing question after question. Luckily for him, Harry was more than happy enough to help in his pursuit of parseltongue research. 

“

What would you like to eat

,” hissed Harry, scrunching his nose and licking his lips. “Parseltongue makes my mouth dry.” 

This time, Theodore didn’t even bother responding. Instead, he simply delved back into his notebook, furiously jotting down words across the pages. It was an utter mess of knowledge— no one, besides Theodore himself, could ever dream of deciphering the page’s contents. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Ron?” 

The first-year redhead froze, making his best 

I’m-not-up-to-anything-suspicious

 face. Unfortunately, it wasn’t very convincing, and Percy’s gaze narrowed sharply at his younger brother. It wasn’t long before the prefect’s observant eyes trailed down into the letter in the former’s hand, fingers gripped around the sealed envelope tightly. 

“Who’s that for?” asked Percy slowly. 

“It’s…” Ron swallowed, glancing around shiftily. He had been on his way to owlery— and Percy was on his way 

back 

from the owlery. A candle started flaming inside the first-year’s head, and with little time under his brother’s scrutiny, the young Gryffindor jumped head-first into the first idea he got. “Oh, is that Oliver’s Quidditch subscription?” 

The prefect seemed surprised that the younger knew about the subscription, surprised enough to take the distraction. “Yeah. How’d you know…?” 

“Well,” Ron shrugged, “I’ve seen Oliver reading 

Weekly Quidditch 

in the common room basically every Friday; the magazine is released every Thursday in most book shops in Diagon Alley, and yesterday Fred asked you if he could borrow Hermes and you said he was in London.” 

“Right.” Percy nodded, looking impressed at his brother’s sudden arisal of deduction abilities. “Of course.” 

“And I’m writing a letter to Charlie,” said Ron truthfully, deciding that the best course of action was to stick to the real story as much as possible. “One of my friends recently developed an interest in dragons, and we were wondering if Charlie could send over some reference books cause we’ve already finished all the ones in the library.” 

It seemed as if Percy bought this lie, hook, line, and sinker, as he smiled approvingly at his brother’s academic pursuit in fire-breathing reptiles. “Alright. Don’t be gone too long, it’s almost curfew.” 

Ron nodded, unable to help the triumphant, relieved smile on his face as Percy left, whistling a merry tune as he skipped the rest of the way.

Notes:

Okay so a few eggs I wanted to say cause I didnt manage to sneak them into the chapter- Harry hesitated on saying 'Norbert' in snake because there is no direct translation for 'Norbert' in parseltongue- Percy is convinced that his brothers all think that he and Oliver are just 'really good friends' when all of them kinda know that theyre together. Romantically.- I headcannon Ron to be like a jack of all trades, because he picks up little things from each of his brothers. He's less academic smarts but very street smarts. Especially when it comes to avoiding getting pranked by the twins.Also, I named the password snake in honor of a late friend <3 He was, indeed, a snake. Caused us a lot of problems by up and leaving like that, smh.







Chapter 21: Mission Impossible...?


Notes:
As I post this, I'm on a train back to my late friend's hometown (he wanted us to visit his hometown w him during our semester break) and listening to Cinema Paradiso's Love Theme. Hopefully, the scenery gives me the energy to speedrun the next few chapters :D



Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

For the miss-matched group of snakes and lions, the afternoon was as normal as can be, until Ron burst into the library, shooting an apologetic look at appalled Madam Pince. Draco rolled his eyes at the redhead’s entrance, but aside from the blonde, the rest of the gang perked up in interest, knowing that the Gryffindor brought news with him. 

“Charlie’s replied!” he whispered excitedly, waving a letter in front of their faces like candy before a toddler. “He says,” Ron took a moment to catch his breath, ripping the letter apart. Even Hermione was too eager to know the contents to launch into a lecture about littering. “... He’ll meet us at the astronomy tower, Saturday night!” 

As silently as they could, the group cheered, until Harry noticed the glaring flaw. “Sorry to interrupt the excitement, but…” the boy cleared his throat awkwardly, “How are we getting Norberta up to the astronomy tower…?” 

The excited skidded to a halt, rather like a comical car, braking right before a cliff. 

“That…” Hermione bit her lip, frowning worriedly. “Is a good question.” 

“Also… Doesn’t Hogwarts have an invisible shield around it that prevents people from apparating or flying in?” said the green-eyed boy meekly, knowing very well he was being the wettest blanket of all. “How are Charlie and his friends going to meet us at the Astronomy Tower if they can’t even get past the barrier?” 

Ron grinned smartly. “

That

, won’t be an issue. You see,” he lowered his voice, as if sharing a secret. The rest of the first years leaned closer, and across the library, Madam Pince squinted at the suspicious group of students— but on second thought, brushed it away. After all, they were only first years— how much trouble could they get into? “A few years ago, my eldest brother— Bill— and Charlie…” Ron glanced at his friends, all listening with rapt attention. “... they created a hole in the barrier that even 

Dumbledore 

himself doesn’t know of.”

“How sure are you?” Theodore asked absent-mindedly, eyeing the proud-looking Ron. 

“Very.” Ron affirmed. “Bill’s a master curse breaker for Gringotts— he began studying protection spells, sigils, charms— all before he graduated. Breaking through Dumbledore’s shield was his greatest achievement then— not anymore, of course, because he does much 

cooler 

things now.”  

“Turns out, the Weasleys are smarter than they appear.” shrugged Draco, impressed but pretending he wasn’t. 

“If Charlie and his friends were to meet us at Hagrid’s hut, they’d have to fly past a 

lot 

of towers and windows, which will increase the chance of them getting caught by someone walking by.” explained Ron apologetically. “So we’ve 

got 

to meet them at the tower.” 

Harry nodded. “Alright, so there’s nothing we can do about the location. We just have to… Figure out a way to sneak Norberta into the castle, and up the Astronomy Tower…” Saying it seemed easy enough— “

without 

being seen.” 

The group glanced at each other, as if waiting for a candle to light above one of their heads, generating an out-of-the-world, foolproof idea. 

“Harry can keep Norberta calm, right?” suggested Neville. 
“It’s just that to keep her calm, I have to pet her constantly and whisper to her the whole way.” returned Harry gloomily. “If we do that— unless we can get a spell that ‘mutes’ me and Norberta— we’re bound to get caught. Professor McGonagall or someone else’s bound to get suspicious if they hear me going ‘good girl, Norberta, good girl’ over and over again.” 
“Why don’t we just,” said Ron brightly, “Knock her out? She’s a 

baby

, it can’t be that hard— we can just use a really strong bucket and 

smack

— problem solved.” 

“That’s actually not a bad idea, in concept.” Theodore hummed. 

“Are we magical children or what?” Hermione sighed, holding her head in her hands. “Let’s resort to a more 

civilised 

method— a 

sleeping potion

.” 

Ron blinked. “Oh. Okay, that makes a lot more sense.” 

“I know potions isn’t my best subject, but…” Neville hesitated. “Let’s say we 

do 

get our hands on a sleeping potion, it would’ve been brewed to take effect on a 

human

, not a dragon, right…?” 

“Good to know all my hard work hasn’t gone to waste.” snorted Draco, who had been spending a good amount of time hurling criticism at the other’s poor potions background. “But yes, Longbottom’s right. Any sleeping potion we steal from the infirmary will have been made for humans— and a dragon’s nervous system will have much, 

much 

higher resistance than a human’s. The sleeping potion simply 

won’t 

work.” 

“Then where do we find a sleeping potion made for a dragon?” Hermione bit her lip, thinking seriously. 

Theodore sat up straight, eyes bright with a wild fire. “Simple,” he grinned, clapping his hands together. “We 

make 

one.” 

“... And here I thought Gryffindors were the ones in charge of rash ideas.” Ron smirked, crossing his arms. 

Neville raised his hand. “As politely as possible, I object.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“All of these calculations are made under the assumption that a dragon’s affinity to sleeping potions is linear to the adult human to adult dragon ratio.” explained Harry, pointing his wand at the drawing board they had borrowed from one of the empty classrooms. “Generally speaking, we’ll need about three times the ingredients needed for a 

human 

sleeping potion.” 

The group were huddled in one of the empty classrooms, with professors Potter and Granger at the front while the rest took their seats in the students’ tables. The drawing board usually used for writing spell incantations was now filled from top to bottom with complex arithmancy— all thanks to the two’s Muggle education. 

“There are one million and three thousand ways that our sleeping potion can go wrong,” continued Hermione. Seeing Ron’s raised hand, she gestured at him. “Yes?” 

“How exactly did you find the one million and three thousand ways that the potion could go wrong?” Ron raised an eyebrow. “Just curious about the… specifics of that number.” 

“It was figurative.” Hermione sighed, exasperated. “Continuing from where I left off— there are— 

a lot

— of ways that our potion can go wrong, and given the time constraint, we’re not going to have enough time for a trial run. As such, we’re going to have back up plans—” 

“A really, strong bucket?” suggested Ron. 

“No.” Hermione replied flatly, gesturing for Neville to take the stage. 
“We— um, the Gryffindors— have Herbology tomorrow.” Neville said, flipping the drawing board around from Harry and Hermione’s tedious calculations, to a poster of a plant, with a funnel-form flower. “And this plant here— is called the Sleeper’s Trumpet. Every two hours or so, it periodically puffs pollen into the air, and once someone breathes in enough of the pollen, they go into an induced sleep.” 
Harry gave the Gryffindor a thumbs up and a supportive smile. 

“Professor Sprout has a few specimens of this plant,” said Neville, trying not to let his voice shake. “From today until Saturday night, there’s enough time to collect over 100 centimetre cubes of the Sleeper’s gas— which, in case the potion wears off, should be enough to keep Norberta under for a couple more minutes.” 

“So on top of needing to steal potion ingredients— we need to steal a deadly plant that can put us to sleep with 

pollen

, too.” Ron summarised. 

The redhead’s fellow Gryffindor cleared his throat. “I was thinking of 

nicely asking 

Professor Sprout for it.” 

“I’ll still bring a bucket just in case.” resolved the youngest Weasley brother. 

“I believe it’s my turn to speak?” Theodore stood up brightly, catching the piece of chalk the muggleborn threw at him. “Listen up.” Tapping the drawing board with his wand, the first years watched as it magically cleared away all of Harry and Hermione’s calculations. “It’s time for Operation-Infiltrate-Snape’s-Potion-Store-For-Norberta’s-Sleeping-Potion-Ingredients.” 

Silence resumed. 

Theodore rolled his eyes. “It’s a working title.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Severus was having as good of a night as he could— his group of fourth-year, potion-taking dunderheads weren’t making it very easy. The professor loved assigning minimum 4-feet long essays to torture his students— but somedays, he found that it was more torturing 

himself 

than his essay writers. Head in hands, the man scribbled cutting remarks on the bottom page margin before tossing the paper aside, moving on to the next. 

Two sharp knocks came at his office door, and absent-mindedly, the professor waved his left hand, letting the door swing open. In came the muggleborn of his first-year snakes, empty parchment in hand. Internally, Severus groaned, already regretting his life decisions. 

“Professor,” chirped the young girl, “I’ve got some questions regarding the essay that’s due tomorrow—” 

“The dropbox exists for a reason, Ms. Granger,” sighed Severus tiredly, “In fact, it exists 

solely

 for 

you

.” 

Hermione pouted. “But the essay’s due tomorrow! There won’t be enough time for me to leave my questions—” 

“Alright, alright,” Severus interrupted, already looking three times more exhausted. “Go on.” 

Brightening, the muggleborn began launching off her list of never-ending questions. “The topic you’ve assigned us was 

Effects of the Living Draught on Existing Conditions

— I was wondering, would—” 

Despite all her attention seemingly going into firing inquiries at the tired professor, Hermione’s gaze was, in fact, flitting all over the room, picking up the locations of the ingredients they needed. Whenever the professor spoke to answer her, the muggleborn scribbled hastily on her blank parchment, recording the shelves they needed to get to, so that their infiltration would go on much faster without having to search all over. 

“Ms. Granger, this information should be readily available in your 

textbook

, which I believe you have memorised from cover to cover.” Severus pointed out. 

“Yes, but the information only covers the topic rather shallowly, and I wasn’t sure if that was enough, since you said we needed ten points in our essay—” continued Hermione. 

Meanwhile, standing outside the professor’s office, the one and only Theodore Nott was running a Norse detection spell, which beeped softly every time it found a magical tripwire of some kind. The boy was unsure if he should be impressed or annoyed— the head of Slytherin had carefully woven an entire network of charms, sigils, and protection spells around his quarters, making it a headache to infiltrate. ‘Cutting’ through the weaves was a no-go— once a single spell was cut off completely, the potions professor was sure to know. The only way to bypass the woven net of magical tripwires was to carefully, meticulously ‘pull’ the weaves apart to form a slight space in between. Of course, this was all easier said than done. 

“That’s all.” Hermione said brightly, when she had found each and every ingredient they needed. “Have a good night, professor!” 

Once she shut the office door behind her, the muggleborn smiled triumphantly, giving Theodore a thumbs up. The other boy returned the smile, the two high-fiving in success. Without another moment to waste, they hurried back to the Slyherin common room, eager to share the fruits of their trip. 

Back in his office, Severus Snape frowned— it might’ve just been his exhaustion, but he could’ve sworn he felt some kind of Norse magic at work, right outside his quarters… 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Mr. Longbottom, Mr. Weasley,” said Professor Sprout kindly, spotting the two Gryffindors lingering behind even after the rest of their class departed. “Do you have a question?” 

“Yes ma’am.” said Neville shyly. “I’ve recently taken an interest in 

Sleeper’s Trumpet

, and I’d 

love 

to own one of them, so I was wondering… if you had a specimen of it?” 

The head of Hufflepuff eyed Neville before sighing fondly, giving into the Gryffindor’s pleading gaze. “Alright, Mr. Longbottom. 

But

— you 

have 

to promise me that you will care for it properly. I am certain you know the consequences should the plant’s fumes get around your dormitory.” 

“Of course.” nodded Neville eagerly. 

Ten minutes later, the Gryffindor duo were trampling back towards the castle, Neville cooing happily at the Sleeper’s Trumpet in his hands. Professor Sprout had been kind enough to provide the Herbology enthusiast with an entire set of apparatus needed to maintain the sleep-inducing plant, including a glass case to keep the plant in, which had a little funnel at the top should Neville want to collect Sleeper’s gas. She’d also given him a gas mask and special goggles, for when he needed to open the glass case to water and trim the trumpet. 

If one good thing came out of Operation Dragon, it was that Neville got to add another plant to his vast collection. The window in the first year Gryffindor’s dormitory was very, 

very 

quickly becoming Neville’s private nursery. 

On the night of Operation Sleeping Potion (Hermione had proposed the new title, with majority support from the rest of the group), they— Harry, Hermione, Theodore, Ron, and Neville— headed down to the professor’s quarters, while Draco lurked the area outside Snape’s class— third year Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors. 

“Ready?” whispered Hermione, although there was no one else in the corridor. “Alright. Commencing Operation Sleeping Potions— 

now

.” 

The group paused. It was rather anticlimactic. 

“Um, alright. Harry, Hermione, get in formation.” Theodore glanced at the other two, who had arranged themselves in an equilateral triangle. Taking a deep breath, the boy cupped his hands together, his chanting filling the air: “

Hoenir, gi oss din velsignelse— la oss låne stillheten din

. 

Loki, den store ugagnens gud, gi oss ditt sinn

.” 

Around the trio, sigils had started forming on the floor, the colour of Theodore’s soft, woodland-green eyes. A perfect circle traced itself into the ground, feeding on the Norse boy’s magic, encasing Hermione and Harry with the former. 

“

Vis oss passasjen

,” Theodore murmured, “

Tillate oss

—” 

It was at this terrible, 

terrible 

moment that dust fell from the dungeon ceiling, floating softly onto Neville’s nose. Ron noticed his fidgeting, eyes widening in horror as he rushed over, hand outstretched. The shorter Gryffindor scrunched his hands up, nails digging into his palm as he tried desperately not to— 

“Achoo!” As soft as Neville’s little kitten sneeze was, it still broke Theodore’s concentration. The Norse spell, which had begun crawling towards the potion master’s quarters, faltered for a moment, flickering waveringly. Thankfully, the Slytherin boy got a quick grip of himself, continuing on as if nothing had happened. Once Theodore’s steady voice returned to the lines of Norwegian speak, the spell strengthened, glowing strong once more. 

Without any more accidents, the spell was completed. Theodore breathed quietly, the exhaustion of dabbling in Norse magic taking a toll on him. Cautiously, Ron approached the door, pushing it open gently before glancing wildly at the corridor, as if he expected Snape to thunder down in his dungeon bat fashion any moment. 

“Go on.” hurried Hermione. “Theodore, you too.” 

Muttering an incantation under his breath to transfer ‘ownership’ of the spell to Harry, Theodore followed after the other, the two tallest students of the group heading into the office, copies of Hermione’s hastily-scribed ingredient locations in hand. The muggleborn had assigned specific ingredients to the two, so that they wouldn’t get jumbled and grab two servings of the same element. 

A few corridors away, in one of the potions classrooms, Severus frowned, having an unexplained feeling that something wasn’t right. For the briefest of moments, the charms around his quarters fizzled quietly, like an old light bulb with a small pinch of electricity. The warnings quickly disappeared after— as if they had become muffled by a spell of some kind. The potion master was not one to believe in the sixth sense, but there was this nagging voice in his head…

“Dismissed.” said Severus abruptly, startling his class. Without waiting for them to pack up, he stormed out of the room, his robes flapping ominously behind him. As he rounded the corner, his eyes caught a flash of blond— then soft, scurrying footsteps. Whoever it was— they had sent a scout to watch him. 

Whipping out his wand, the professor growled thunderously, prepared to throw hexes at the invaders of his private quarters. Wordlessly, he cast charms preventing the burglars from fleeing down the opposite corridor. A wicked snarl crept across his face as he stepped into the hallway, smirking, a drawl already dancing across his voice, prepared to catch the perpetrators red-handed.

“Well, well, 

well

—" 

Severus stopped.

The corridor was empty.

“Let’s 

never 

do that again,” panted Harry, clutching his chest. Minutes ago, Draco had barrelled into their corridor, and just by looking at the panic on his face, the other first years knew that not too far away, the dungeon bat was coming their way. Hermione dashed into the office, helping Theodore and Ron shove the rest of their ingredients into a pre-prepared storage container. Outside the office, Harry hastily retrieved an erasing sigil—a small, translucent, wax-stamp-like object, tossing it onto the ground where Theodore’s Norse spell sat. Instantly, the light ebbed away, and within seconds, it was almost as if it hadn't been there in the first place. 

They were out of the corridor just 

right 

before Snape’s spell locked down. Without waiting to see the furious expression on their head of house, the students scurried away, escaping by the skin of their teeth. 

“We could’ve been 

expelled

!” breathed Hermione, shuddering at the idea. 

“You say that like we forced you to come with us!” snapped Ron. 

“Enough, enough.” Harry said, forcing himself between the two. “We got away without getting caught. We’ll think about what Professor Snape will do to us— 

only 

if we get caught. Too late for us to back out now, we’ve got the ingredients.” 

“I agree.” hummed Theodore, although his face was still flushed from running. “We’ll just head on with the plan— 7pm tonight, girls’ bathroom on the second floor. Don’t be late.” 

With that, the group dispersed, heading back to their respective common rooms. For some, 7pm couldn’t come fast enough, and for some, it came too fast. Regardless, when at last the clock struck seven, they gathered in attendance, with Draco scrunching his nose in disgust as they stepped into the unused bathroom. 

“Good evening, Myrtle.” greeted Theodore eloquently. “I hope you don’t mind— I’ve brought my friends. We’ve got a little… 

project

 going on. If you could keep this a secret from everyone else, with the exception of those of us who are present— I’d 

greatly 

appreciate it.” 

The ghost agreed readily, swooning as her drenched, outdated Hogwarts robes floated translucently behind her. 

It didn’t take them long to get to work. For a group of first years, some of which had just been introduced to the concept of magic merely months prior, they were swift workers, and although there were hiccups here and there, they were quickly resolved. More often than not, Harry found himself playing the role of peacemaker, as between Draco, Ron and Hermione, fights were bound to spark if the three were left unsupervised. 

“Stir clockwise until the potion changes colour,” Theodore instructed, flipping through their research notebook. Various notes, done in Draco’s perfected, cursive writing; Harry’s small, neat scribble; Hermione’s slanted, tall letters, and Theodore’s incomprehensible (except to him) scrawl littered among the pages, on sticky notes and extra flaps of paper taped onto the notebook. 

“It’s changing,” called out Harry behind his back, steadily stirring the cauldron’s contents with the metal stirrer he was levitating. “What next?” 

“Three pinches of dusted fairy wings,” Theodore recited, tracing the instructions with his finger. “Then immediately after, finely crushed oak marrow.” 

“Just a bit more, Longbottom,” Draco directed, towards the side. Neville was clutching a mortar and pestle in his hands, carefully grinding the oak marrow as the blonde Slytherin guided him. “The instructions say 

finely crushed

, so don’t stop until it’s as fine as you can get it.”

Listening attentively, Neville noted down everything the other was saying, keeping it mind for his upcoming potions exam. “Like this?” 

“Just a little bit more. Look closely— you can still see some clumps that aren’t fully powdered yet.” Draco pointed out. “Weasley, at this rate, Longbottom’s going to have a better potions grade than you.” 

“I’m studying too!” defended the redhead, who was crouched over his potions textbook, occasionally glancing up to observe what the others were doing. 

Pursing her lips in concentration, Hermione gently rubbed her fingers over the cauldron, depositing 

just 

three pinches of fairy wings into the bubbling concoction. Once she was done, Draco took the mortar from Neville, brushing all of their crushed oak marrow into the potion, careful not to waste a single grain. Instantly, the liquid started frothing, composition transforming right under their eyes into a mercury-like substance. 

“All that’s left is to let it simmer for forty-seven minutes.” concluded Theodore, clapping the notebook shut with an expression of satisfaction. “One agenda done— what’s next?” 

A few minutes later, Neville was sitting in a large, wooden crate, looking uneasy and terrified for his life. “I don’t like this, guys,” he whined, “Can’t someone else be Norberta instead?”

“On the count of three,” Hermione directed, everyone ignoring the Gryffindor’s plea for help. The first-years were gathered around the wooden crate that they had acquired from the kitchens— it had been used to keep big fruits. “One— Two— Three!” 

In unison, the six first years pointed their wands at the crate, saying the incantation: “

Wingardium leviosa

!”. Neville yelped, ducking into the crate in fear of looking over the edge. Slowly, the crate levitated into the air, shaking from side to side unsurely, much to poor Neville’s despair. 

“Steady now…” Hermione said encouragingly, keeping her eyes on the crate. Cautiously, the group started moving the crate (with Neville) across the bathroom, walking a full circle before lowering the Gryffindor back onto safe floors. “That wasn’t too bad, but we could 

definitely 

improve our coordination.” 

Neville, who had been halfway clambering out of the crate, was then pinpointed with an expectant stare from the bushy-haired Slytherin, and with a resigned sigh, tucked himself back into the wooden box. It took a couple more laps around the bathroom, Myrtle watching them all with great interest, but soon enough they were able to levitate the crate as one without verbal directions from Hermione, and a few more rounds later, Neville assured them that the journey would be smooth enough to keep Norberta in slumber for her trip up the Astronomy Tower. 

“Oh,” Theodore said, glancing quickly at his inherited pocket-watch, “It’s almost time to take the potion off the fire. Harry?” 

Nodding in acknowledgement, the green-eyed Slytherin crossed the bathroom, trotting over like a baby deer, waving his wand and murmuring an incantation under his breath. As if getting sucked by a vacuum, the fire smushed itself together, and in a steady stream, floating back into Harry’s wand. The boy smiled, satisfied with his magical technique, and gave Theodore a thumbs-up. The group instantly gathered around the cauldron, peaking and prodding at each other to see the fruits of their hard work. 

“Looks just about perfect.” Theodore announced proudly. “We’ve got about everything down for Operation: Dragon.” 

“Just one more thing,” piped up Hermione with a charming smile. “

Deceptione diaphanum

.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Saturday night, and Severus 

still 

couldn’t get a grip on the identity of the little 

brats 

that stole from him. It absolutely infuriated him that a handful of students— he assumed they were students— had gotten under his nose, gotten past his protection charms— and stole from him! 

A quick check of the ingredients they had taken gave him a rough idea of what they were planning to make: either several doses of Sleeping Draught 

or 

an Intoxication Reversal— in other words, a hangover cure. He was convinced it was one of the older years, wanting a surefire way to show up to class 

sober 

after a night of drinking. But to go so far as to steal from him… Severus couldn’t help but have doubts. Afterall, what student in their right minds would steal from him 

just 

to brew an Intoxication Reversal? There were simpler ways of curing a hangover. 

He was sure that the thieves would be all giggly and mischievous-looking on the night of Saturday, when they were just about to start their drinking spree, and slunked out from his quarters, in hunt of those guilty. Within his mind, he had already begun concocting punishments for when he caught the perpetrators— they wouldn’t be let off easily. Although he wouldn’t admit it, the thieves had not only stolen from him, but greatly damaged his pride and confidence in his protection charms— to think someone had gotten past his barriers that easily!

As he strode into the Great Hall, he couldn’t help but catch a couple of shocked gazes— and even a surprised yelp. Suspiciously, he eyed his first-year Slytherins, who smiled meekly back as a response. Hermione even chirped in a: “Good evening, Professor!”, although it didn’t diminish any of the uneasiness in Severus’s mind. 

Sure, he didn’t attend dinners on weekends often— but did his first-years have to act that surprised? The more he thought about it, the more apprehensive he was. Was it possible… that his first-year snakes were the ones behind the thievery…?

“— Severus!” 

The potions professor snapped out from where he was, engrossed with tracing the person(s) behind the crime. Minerva was staring at him, mildly annoyed— she must’ve been calling him. 

 “For the love of 

Merlin

, where has your mind wandered, Severus?” she huffed, looking cross. For a moment, the Slytherin had a flashback to his schoolboy days— while Poppy had promised to keep his secrets, Minerva eventually found out about his homelife, and about Slughorn’s… 

inability 

to care for a student such as him. “I was just asking if you’ve finished preparing the revisional papers for your seventh-year students, Albus needs me to begin drafting a revision schedule for those taking their NEWTS— Severus, are you listening?” 

He was, in fact, not listening. 

Instead, his eyes were trained on a group of suspicious first-years leaving the hall, whispering hushes at each other, the rest of the hall ignorant of the mischief the four snakes and two lions were off to commit. Sure— the students who finished their meals were allowed to leave, to roam the castle as long as they retreated back to their commons before curfew— but a nagging feeling told Severus that there was no innocence in the six students’ timely exit. 

“Sorry. Please excuse me.” Severus said absent-mindedly, leaving his seat, having only taken two bites of his food. He swept out of the Great Hall, his robes flapping ominously behind him as the remaining students prayed for whoever had caused the potions master to depart on a warpath. 

For their short legs, they walked rather fast, Severus thought. He hurried down the corridors, careful not to be too fast, in case they caught sight of him and halted their plans before he could catch them red-handed. As he finally rounded the last corner, he caught sight of six little silhouettes, three lanterns between them as they stumbled over the grassy fields towards Hagrid’s hut. 

“It’s minutes to curfew,” muttered Severus under his breath. What were the little troublemakers doing? Perhaps children like Draco, Neville, Ron, Theodore— they could easily lose track of time, but Harry and Hermione— those two were responsible enough to know when they were supposed to be back in their commons. Surely they didn’t think a five-minute window was sufficient for a trip down to the hut and 

back

? 

Making his decision, the Slytherin decided to hide in wait, to smirk and smile smugly as the students returned, dishing out detentions as he did so. There was a satisfaction to giving Minerva’s lions punishments— and besides, his first-year snakes needed to learn, too, that there was no messing with him— or else they would go the rest of their seven years thinking they had free roam of the Hogwarts’ ground. 

Severus was a patient man; he could wait. 

So he waited. 

And waited.

And waited. 

And they never came back. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────


Bang!


Hagrid’s front door was flung open, a livid potions master standing in the doorway, glancing around worriedly for his missing students. A sobbing half-giant in hysterics greeted him, as well as a floor of used, snot-soaked tissues. In normal circumstances, Severus would have scrunched up his nose in disgust— but there were more pressing matters on hand. Six students ventured down to Hagrid’s hut minutes before curfew, and never returned. The potions master stood by the main castle entrance for the whole time, keeping his eyes trained on the grassy plains— no soul crossed the field, and no soul crossed the entrance. 

“Where are they?” Severus demanded, having no time for Hagrid’s emotional meltdown. “Hagrid, for the love of 

Merlin

— those kids— they came down here, didn’t they?

 Where are they

?” 

“They— they took— Norbert— 

Norberta

—” Hagrid cried loudly, blowing his nose onto a napkin with so much force that Severus almost flew back out the doorway. “

Norberta

— oh, she’s just a baby, she’s not ready to leave yet—” 

The potions master was ready to slap someone. “I asked you where the kids are, Hagrid,” Severus snapped, “— who the 

fuck 

is 

Norberta

, anyway?” 

“

Norberta

— my baby,” sniffled Hagrid, bawling his eyes out at the name again. “Oh, my littl’ 

baby

, 

Norberta

— she wa’ such a beautiful girl, the absolute pretties’— her smooth scales, those cute littl’ smoke-breathing nostrils—” 

Just as he was about to snap another remark, the truth dawned on Severus, the puzzle pieces flying together in his head, the big picture forming— 

Merlin,

 no. “Hagrid,” Severus began slowly, his lungs feeling more constricted by the moment. “Norberta… is a 

dragon

.” The half-giant nodded and blew his nose so loudly it shook the foundations of his home. “And you are telling me… that 

six first-years 

are running around 

somewhere 

with a 

dragon 

in their hands?” 

“They— they said Norberta would burn my hous’ down if I kept her ‘ere,” Hagrid sobbed, wiping his eyes with the same napkin he used for his snot, “Insisted that they gave her away to somewhere safe— whats’ his name— Charles—” 

“Charlie Weasley.” Severus guessed quickly, urging the half-giant on impatiently. “Okay, so they’ve got a dragon, and they’re trying to hand it off to Charlie Weasley. Where?” 

“

Norberta

—” Hagrid went off again, picking a used tissue from the floor and blowing into it. “

Norberta

, you’ll be good for Charlie, won’t ya— you’ll be good, an’— an’ you’ll have 

friends

—”

“Hagrid, 

where are they meeting Charlie

?” Severus hissed, almost at the end of his tolerance. He was worried out of his mind and Hagrid was 

not 

helping. “

Hagrid!

” 

“The— the astronomy tower.” Hagrid sniffled, “Severus— don’t be mad at ‘em. They wanted to go to you abou’— about Norberta, but— but Harry was scared you’d get meh fired, or— or not let ‘em come down to see me again— they’re good kids, really—” 

Having gotten the information he needed, Severus thundered out of the house. He hadn’t gotten any answers on 

how 

they had gotten past him, but at least he knew where they were heading. A rough blueprint of the castle formed in his head— knowing Harry— or Hermione, or Theodore, for that matter— those three were way too bright and witty for their own good— they must’ve plotted the shortest way up to the tower. Severus knew, more-or-less, which way they would be taking. 

There was no time to waste. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────


This is why

, Severus hissed to himself, 

I never had kids

. 

When he was young, he had imagined thirty-year-old Severus being the pioneer of potions making, breaching new frontiers and introducing more efficient methods into the industry, but there he was, in a dusty, old castle, trying to chase down six children he 

could not see

. He had no idea 

how

, but the kids must’ve mastered a disillusionment charm of some sort— on second thought, given their combined brains, it might not have been completely unachievable. 

It wasn’t as if he didn’t have 

years 

of spy experience under his belt, however. About 5 minutes later, he had roughly located where the kids were— he didn’t know 

exactly 

where, but he could point in their general location. If he listened closely, he could hear the scuffling of their shoes, their quickened breathing, and the whispers they passed like notes in class. 

“We’re almost there,” Hermione whispered, trying to sound reassuring— the shake in her voice gave it away, however. She was just as nervous, if not 

more

, as the rest of them. “Astronomy tower’s just up ahead…” 

The young wixen trailed off, and Severus glanced up to see why. Descending into the very same corridor they were in were Minerva ana Argus— the two people troublemaking students wanted 

least 

to run into, while they were in the midst of their plans. Although he couldn’t see them, Severus could practically 

feel 

their fear as all of them stood frozen, completely unmoving. 

Realising that the two adults were about to bump right into the kids (and the dragon), Severus slinked out from the shadows, taking 

everyone 

by surprise. “Good evening, Minerva, Argus.” he greeted coolly, subtly manoeuvring himself so that the adults would move towards him— and clear the way for the first-years to proceed.”... Caught any students out past curfew yet?” 

Before anyone could reply, the loudest, most abrupt, raspy-sounding 

yawn 

echoed through the corridor. It was clear to everyone that it was no human that made the sound, making the alarm in Minerva’s eyes multiply tenfold. “What…?” she blinked, glancing around wildly, staring at the approximate origin of the sound but finding 

nothing

. 

“Well, if you’ll excuse me,” Severus continued, as if he had heard nothing, subtly speaking louder to cover the scuffling of six first-years’ feet. “I believe a few students are out of bed past curfew— I’ve got some detention to give out.” He smiled, rather wickedly. “Good night, Minerva, Argus.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“That was painfully close,” breathed Ron, who felt like his heartbeat was as loud as a thousand drums. Not only did they run into Professor McGonagall and Filch, they ran into 

Snape

, too. Luckily, Harry had the forethought to feed Mrs. Norris some catnip before their operation, so she wouldn’t sniff them out and come bounding, giving them all away. At the moment, the feline was snoozing away happily in Filch’s office, dreaming of dead rats and cat treats. 

“Right.” Hermione shivered at the thought of getting caught. Behind her, Harry and Neville were feeding Norberta the Sleeper Trumpet’s gas, the Gryffindor holding the glass tube to the dragon’s snout as the other stroked the dragon and whispered soothingly. “Oh— is that them? Is that Charlie?” 

At Hermione’s excited words, the rest of them glanced up to see— it was Charlie, indeed, with three friends, riding their broomsticks into Hogwarts’ grounds. Unable to contain their excitement, the first-years whooped (quietly, so as not to wake Norberta) and let down their disillusionment charms. The whole dragon affair was about to be over, very, very soon. 

“Sup,” Charlie greeted as they finally landed, whistling appreciatively as he settled his eyes on the snoozing Norwegian Ridgeback. “Ooh, she’s a beauty indeed. A 

sleeping

 beauty, I should say.” He chuckled, approaching the box as the first-years parted for him like the Red Sea. “Alright! Let’s get this crate hooked up, and we’ll be outta your hair.” 

Charlie’s other dragonist friends got to work immediately, retrieving heavy-duty hooks from their satchels, attaching them to four corners of the crate and to their broomsticks. A few additional spells were casted over Norberta to ensure that the journey into Romania would be uneventful, and with that, they were ready to depart. 

“A’ite.” Charlie clapped his hands, grinning at his juniors. “I honestly can’t believe you, Ronnikins— smuggling dragons in your first year. Mom would ground you until you’re 

thirty 

if she ever found out.” 

“You won’t tell mum, right?” protested Ron, looking horrified at the idea. 

“Don’t be stupid— of course not.” Charlie rolled his eyes. “I’d be in trouble, too, for helping you with this whole operation.” With one last wink and a salute at the first-years, Charlie climbed onto his broomstick, tugging on the chain to make sure it was secure. “That’ll be it, lads— work hard in school, got it?” 

“Bye!” The first-years chorused, waving off the former Gryffindor as he took to the skies with his friends, a dragon-containing crate hovering beneath them. 

With Norberta gone, at last, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, all the tension in their shoulders disappearing all at once. All the anxiety they had been carrying for the past week was suddenly 

gone

— gone, along with the dragon. Just as they got to their feet, ready to drag themselves back to their common rooms for a good night of sleep— 

“If I were you,” Severus smiled, his anger thinly veiled by the expression he wore. “I wouldn’t have let down my disillusionment charm until I was 

back 

at the common rooms.”

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Harry had never felt that terrified before in his 

entire life

. 

They were gathered in Snape’s office, as he ordered the night before: “

It’s rather late

,” he had said, eyeing all of them with that same, cold smile on his features, “

I’d suggest for you lot to head to bed. I expect to see you in my office tomorrow morning, 8am sharp— no excuses

.” 

8am came 

way 

too fast— the potions professor looked completely unbothered, absent-mindedly flipping through his fifth-year students’ essays in mild interest— almost as if there weren’t six very, 

very 

terrified first years standing before him. No one dared to break the silence— what could they say, anyway? All things considered, it would probably be less stressful if the professor just straight up 

yelled 

at them instead of giving them the silent treatment. 

“Professor,” Hermione blurted at last, unable to take the silence any longer. “We—”

“Hmm?” Severus hummed, glancing up uninterestedly. “One moment, Ms. Granger. As you can 

clearly 

tell, I’m slightly preoccupied at the moment.” Gesturing to his essays, most already painted with various strokes of red, the Head of Slytherin gave his attention back to his papers, ignoring the way Hermione trembled. 

After what seemed like another 

hour 

of Snape’s quill scratching across the parchment, he decided, at last, to slit the deafening silence. 

“I believe you’ve had sufficient time to think about what you’re going to say,” Severus began smoothly, his gaze trailing over each of the first years— some wouldn’t even meet his eyes. “Now, which one of you wants to explain the mystery of my 

missing potion ingredients

?” 

“I was the one who stole it, professor.” In a display of Gryffindor courage, Ron spoke up, trying his best not to let fear shake his voice. 

Irritatedly, Theodore shot at glare at the other, lanky first year. “Shut up.” He snapped, his steely eyes flicking towards the professor’s, “I did most of the work.” There was a huff in Theodore’s voice, as if he was annoyed at Ron for trying to take most of the credit. 

“I— I helped, too…” Neville added meekly, yelping when Severus’s eyes flitted over to his. 

“I know you all had a part in it,” Severus breathed, standing up from his chair, rounding his large desk and approaching the first years, “I want you to tell me 

what 

you did with the ingredients.” 

Hermione inhaled deeply. “We… Webrewedamodifiedsleepingpotionforadragon.” She said all in one breath, wincing and looking anywhere 

but 

at the professor. 

“... Repeat that, but 

slower

, Ms. Granger.” said Severus slowly, his heart rate picking up. Merlin, he hoped he heard her wrong… 

“We brewed a modified sleeping potion for a dragon.” mumbled Harry, fiddling with his fingers, fiddling with the hems of his garments, fiddling with the loose thread on his shirt— 

“You. What.” Severus took a moment to breathe, needing to 

physically 

calm himself down, while the six first years looked on in confusion. None of them had 

any 

idea how dangerous brewing modified potions could be, and the amount of pre-procedural testing that was required before the finalised modifications could be tested out— 

Merlin

, how in 

hell 

was he supposed to explain to the Weasley, Malfoy, Longbottom, Nott, and Granger families if their children had 

died

 brewing with 

his 

ingredients—

“We followed the normal sleeping potions procedure and changed the quantities for it to be strong enough to affect a dragon’s nervous system.” explained Theodore. 

“Yes, I get that, thank you 

very 

much, Mr. Nott.” Closing his eyes, Severus prayed for Merlin to provide him with patience. “Do 

any 

of you understand how volatile modified potions can be? Even

 certified 

potion masters have to go through 

weeks 

of research and testing before the final modified potion can be brewed. If your calculations were even a 

little 

wrong, your potion could’ve blown up— and I’m sure you’re all smart enough to conclude what happens next, since you’re smart enough to 

steal 

from me.” 

The first years were quiet once more. 

“Merlin give me strength.” muttered Severus under his breath. He had a feeling that for as long as the six students roamed Hogwarts’ halls, he would be at risk of heart failure. “Brewing modified potions, 

on top of smuggling a dragon out of school

— Detention, all of you— that should go unsaid— until 

exam week

. I’m not taking any arguments— yes, that includes any arguments from 

you

, Draco, and unless you want me to reply to your mother with a 

very 

comprehensive letter of 

what exactly 

got you into detention, you won’t even 

think 

of telling your parents.” 

Draco, who had opened his mouth, shut it wordlessly. 

“I’m going to assume that you at least did 

some 

research— if you didn’t—” Severus didn’t even want to go down that thought— “... Well, hand it in.” 

The first years glanced at each other, and in the total of two seconds, came to a collective conclusion. Theodore stepped forward, drawing a small, worn notebook from his robes. Already feeling a headache coming on, Severus accepted it, flipping through the pages to find extensive notes, scribbled in handwritings that he could recognise— Harry’s small, neat scribble, Hermione’s tall, slanted letters, Theodore’s incomprehensible scrawl, along with a couple, delicate cursive words from Draco. Additional pages had been stuck in, here and there, where the space had run out. 

Clapping the book shut, Severus tucked it into one of his desk drawers, locking it with a non-verbal spell. 

“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Nott, Ms. Granger,” he began, watching the respective kids flinch (with the exception of Theodore, who just watched him expectantly), “Detention with 

me

 every Saturday and Sunday morning, starting from tomorrow. Mr. Longbottom, Mr. Weasley, detention with Professor Sprout— which I will arrange— I believe she requires help cleaning out the greenhouses.” 

Severus paused, waiting for protests— but none came. 

“Very well. Dismissed.” 

Watching the six eleven-year-olds scamper out of his office, Severus sunk back into his chair with a tired sigh. For the next seven years, he’d have to keep his eyes peeled— Merlin knew those six wouldn’t be able to keep themselves out of trouble. For one, Harry was a trouble magnet; Hermione and Theodore were 

way 

too smart and curious for their own good; Draco was naturally compelled to stick his nose into any business; Ronald was a Gryffindor, enough said; and Neville, well, Neville would just be dragged along, whether he liked it or not. 

On the other hand, however… 

Severus smiled to himself. 

Albus Dumbledore had been thrown off his bearing ever since the young Potter was sorted into Slytherin. The perfect, poster boy the headmaster had wanted never existed. Harry was not naturally charismatic and confident, like his father, and did not have a welcoming, affable presence, like his mother. Instead, Harry James Potter was soft-spoken and humble, shied away from attention and strived to excel in his studies. The headmaster was fumbling in unsure, unknown waters, not knowing what to make of the boy from Privet Drive— which Severus rather liked. Dumbledore loved playing the part of the mysterious, wise figure, always concealing information and tugging his people along like puppets— but how could the senile man tug Harry along when the boy’s strings were cut? 

And now that Harry had made connections— Hermione, with a starving curiosity and a sharp mind that could bring her to the top of the wizarding food chain; Theodore, with nimble, deft hands that delved into ancient Norse magic that Dumbledore could not comprehend; Draco, with an experience in sweet-talking high society; Ron, with nothing apparently special on the surface, but was a jack of trades in making; and Neville, with an outstanding, unnoticed potential in Herbology. 

Severus couldn’t help but smirk this time. 

Forget Albus Dumbledore, the 

Wizarding World 

wouldn’t know what hit them when those six graduated. 

 ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“You’ve got to wake up, Theo,” whispered Harry, shaking the other boy gently. “We’re going to be late for Professor Snape’s detention.” 

Grumbling incoherently, Theodore tugged the blankets over his head in favour of ignoring Harry, who was already decked in his white button-up, green collared sweater pulled over the light garment. Meanwhile, Draco was going through his morning facial routine in the bathroom. Across the dorm, Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle were still sleeping peacefully, enjoying the Saturday morning by staying in bed. 

Sighing dejectedly, Harry gave in. “Alright, but you’ve got to get up once Draco’s out.” 

After what seemed like half an hour, Draco strolled out from the toilet, his hair done, face looking fresh. Looking the complete opposite, Theodore glared at the blonde, his eyes darker than usual as he slammed the bathroom door behind him noisily. 

“Well someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.” Draco huffed, crossing his arms petulantly. 

“Let’s go wait for Hermione and Theo down in the commons.” Harry suggested, tucking his wand into his back pocket. Down at the common rooms, Hermione was already seated on a couch before the fireplace, looking miserable— her perfect track record had been ruined by the potion master’s detention, but she supposed they deserved it. 

“Morning, ‘mione.” greeted Harry softly, sensing that the Muggle-born girl, like Theodore, wasn’t in the best of moods. “If Theo comes out early, we might still have time to grab some breakfast.” He brightened optimistically, trying to cheer her up. Truth was, he felt rather down about the detention, too— but Professor Snape had made a valid point and the detention was completely justified. 

Theodore did 

not 

come out early. 

With no time for a detour, the four Slytherins hurried down the dungeons (well, okay, Harry and Hermione hurried down to the dungeons, Draco insisted on 

strutting 

instead of 

running 

because it was ungentlemanly and he had just done his hair, and sleepy, grumpy Theodore had to be tugged along by the sleeve). As the clock ticked to 8, Hermione raised her hand and knocked, catching her breath. After a moment, the door swung open, and the professor of the dungeons greeted them, dressed in his swoopy, bat-like robes. 

“You’re late.” He told them helpfully. “Follow me.” 

Without waiting for affirmation from the first years, the dungeon bat swept across his office and into a doorway behind the desk. Trotting dutifully behind him were his four snakes, glancing around curiously— they hadn’t had much time to get a good look the last time they were there, as they were rather preoccupied stealing ingredients and trying not to get caught. 

“You’ll be preparing ingredients for my third year class tomorrow.” announced Severus at last. He had led them into a personal lab of sorts, the rows and rows of tables the children were used to replaced by professional looking workbenches. “I will show you 

once

 how to prep these, and once only. Mr. Nott, would you like to wash your face?” 

After a short demonstration on the correct way to remove the thin, protective film over a lacewing’s scaled, butterfly-like wings, and the method to pry a black-tipped sea urchin from its tight, spiky shell, Severus set them to work, leaving them alone in his personal lab as he left for his office. 

Figuring they could’ve been scrubbing dirty cauldrons instead, the group instantly got to work, eyeing the 

jars 

of lacewings and 

buckets 

of urchins they’d have to go through. The lacewings were finicky and the film was way too thin to be seen, requiring an incredibly steady hand, while the urchins— well, they had spiked shells. Enough said. 

By the time they were done, their hands were shaking and they were sweating like mad— almost as if they’d just run laps around the Quidditch pitch instead of sitting in the stone-cold dungeons. 

“Done?” For a moment, there was an expression of mild surprise across the potion masters’ face— almost as if he were 

impressed

. “... The quality of work could be improved, but adequate for your first attempt doing prep.” Severus hummed, examining the de-filmed lacewings. 

The first years watched breathlessly, wondering if they were allowed to leave for the Great Hall now that they were finished— their stomachs were 

grumbling

. 

“I intended to keep you here until 10,” Severus cleared his throat, retrieving a small, black notebook from within his sleeves— the very same notebook they used to make notes for their sleeping potion. “Since there’s half an hour of time… I’ve looked over your research, and there 

were 

slight miscalculations, which might’ve been why your potion wore off much faster than you expected.” 

For the next few minutes, the potions master lectured them on the various mistakes and corrections they could make to their procedure, noting down the changes with his red-inked quill. The first years gathered around him attentively, hanging onto his every word— Theodore, who was looking murderous earlier (he’d poked his fingers on the urchins for the thousandth time), now had a change of heart and was looking much more awake. 

“In basic theory, upping the ratio of certain ingredients may increase the concentration of your dosage, but remember that potions are finicky— increasing the amount of certain things— powdered moon-spider, for instance, makes your potion more unstable. The typical ratio of ingredients had already been tested thousands of times to ensure that all the amounts counter each other to make the most efficient potion— messing around with that is possibly why your potion’s efficiency decreased. And on top of that— like I said, you’ve meddled with the stability of your potion, which is why adding a stabiliser ingredient would be a good idea.” 

“A stabiliser ingredient…” Hermione murmured under her breath. 

“Red-dusted daisies…?” suggested Harry after slight pondering. 

Severus shook his head. “Try again. Red-dusted daisies add heat and explosiveness to a potion, Mr. Potter— quite the opposite of what you’re trying to achieve here.” 

“Snowdrops?” Draco said, grinning pompously when his godfather nodded. 

“For the highest effect possible, the snowdrops should be boiled in low heat, strained and kept on cold stone cubes for at least three hours, then crushed for their sap, which is then added to the potion as a stabiliser.” Theodore concluded, tapping the table thoughtfully. Beside him, Draco gave the other a glare, annoyed at having his limelight stolen. 

“Correct.” Severus couldn’t help but smile slightly, noting what Theodore had said in their notebook. A quick glance at the clock told him they still had twenty-five minutes. “... If you get started now, you can prepare your stabiliser in time for re-brewing the sleeping potion next Saturday.” 

This was all rather unexpected, and resulted in Severus getting pinpointed by four, wide-eyed, surprised stares. 

Embarrassed, the Head of Slytherin cleared his throat, slipping the book across the workbench towards the first years. “Well, there are still cauldrons you could clean—” 

All at once, the four kids scrambled from their seats, Harry and Hermione tidying up their workbench while Theodore and Draco scurried to grab the materials and apparatus they needed. 

“I’ve got the snowdrops 

already

, Draco.” Theodore’s annoyed voice echoed across the lab as Severus headed back to his office to grab a few papers— there was no way he was letting them work in his personal lab without supervision. “Get a simmering stand— no, not that one, 

Draco

, do you know what a simmering stand is?” 

“Of course I do!” Came Draco’s flustered reply. “I’m not an idiot, Nott.” 

“Draco, grab some clippers while you’re at it, we have to de-stem the snowdrops.” Hermione called out, wiping urchin juice from their workbench. Beside her, Harry was tugging a bucket of de-shelled urchins over to the corner.  

Setting down his work on an empty workbench, Severus suppressed the urge to smile fondly— 

no

, he wasn’t getting fond of his little first year snakes— absolutely not, he was Severus Snape, the cold, unbothered dungeon bat, and he definitely 

wasn’t 

feeling proud— no, not proud, like how a parent would be… Definitely not.

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Despite spending Sunday morning in detentions, the six first years were in rather good moods. For one, the four snakes’ snowdrop stabiliser had gone successfully, and was now sitting, bottled up, in the potion master’s office, waiting for their next detention to be used. Neville, on the other hand, was preening happily— his detention with Professor Sprout was more informative than punishing, and even Ron had to admit that it was nice of the Slytherin professor to let Neville serve his detention in the greenhouse. 

And while he wouldn’t say it aloud, Ron had a rather fruitful detention, too. 

Initially, he had mentally prepared himself to be bored for two hours or so while Neville fawned and cooed over various greeneries. However, as he stepped into Professor Sprout’s private greenhouse, filled to the brim with her collection of exotic fauna, the redhead couldn’t help but spot something that sparked his interest. Ahead of him, the two Herbology enthusiasts were already deep in discussion, the Head of Hufflepuff proudly introducing her specimens.

Awkwardly, Ron cleared his throat. “Err… sorry to interrupt, but… what’s that?” 

Surprised by his interest, Professor Sprout turned to the direction of Ron’s gesture. “That’s a sap extraction device, Mr. Weasley,” said the professor, looking vaguely intrigued by his question. “This model in particular is used to extract sap from moderately-sized leaves. Different components of a plant— flower petals or tree bark, for instance, have slightly modified models to enhance the quality of the sap.” 

“It looks like… a blonder?” Ron mused to no one in particular. “Blandere? No… no, a blender!” Making an 

aha! 

face, the redhead flushed with embarrassment when he noticed both the professor and his housemate staring at him in astonishment. “It’s a Muggle… device. Thing.” 

“Well,” Professor Sprout cleared her throat, “If that sparks your interest, Mr. Weasley, I have a storeroom filled with apparatus that could do with some dusting and wiping down—”

She had barely finished her sentence when the Weasley agreed readily— anything other than fawning over plants for an entire morning. After handing him some rags and water, the professor led him into a storeroom filled to the brim with variously-shaped mechanisms used by the Wixen for all their Herbology needs, unable to hide her bewilderment at the bright spark in Ron’s eyes. She attributed it to his father’s passions— it was only natural, she supposed, due to Arthur Weasley’s great interest in Muggle-related matters, that Ron inherited the older redhead’s curiosity. 

As they left their detention, Neville was practically 

vibrating 

with happiness— he had gotten to see exotic specimens of plants he’d only glimpsed in books. By his side, Ron looked comparatively subdued, although there was no denying the muted, flickering ember of his newfound interest.

Back in the present, Hermione had, to no one’s surprise, insisted on another library visit, in honour of the upcoming exam season. 

“To think I’d be spending so much of my first year in the library,” Ron complained as they strolled past the doors, Harry waving politely to Madam Pince as they passed her counter. “Unbelievable.” 

Draco had to agree— he’d imagined more Quidditch playing, more mischief making, and more sneering at the Gryffindors, and much less 

fraternising

. But as it was, Hermione and Harry were topping their classes, and Draco 

refused 

to be left behind by two muggle-background students. His pride would never recover.  

On the other hand, Theodore was barely listening, flipping over the notes Professor Snape made on their notebook. With a stern warning not to try any brewing on their own again, the professor had returned their hard work and detailed research, if only Theodore could look more into the corrections made. 

It went without saying that Severus had doubled the protective charms surrounding his chamber— he wouldn’t say it aloud, but honestly, to have six 

first years 

successfully breach the perimeters of his office— he’d never look anyone in the eye again if word got out. 

While the rest of the first-years settled their things by a rare, empty table in the library— most spots were already booked by senior students, starting to panic about the year’s courseload and the fact a majority of the things they had forgotten about would be tested— Hermione and Theodore instantly left to browse the numerous shelves, the former for reference materials and the latter for any vague, miscellaneous topic that piqued his interest. Shortly after, Neville joined them in their browsing, leaving poor, poor Harry to spectate season 3 of the Weasley-Malfoy feud. 

Luckily, he was quickly saved. 

“Ron, Ron!” Neville whispered excitedly, hurrying back to their table with a thick book in hand. “You won’t believe what I found!” 

In all his excitement, the Gryffindor tripped on the library carpet, the book he was holding flying out of his hands and onto the table, sliding until it stopped, rather climatically, right in front of Ron. Illustrated in bold colours across the cover was an appliance identical to the one they had seen in the greenhouse— a blender. 

“A Beginner’s Guide to Muggle Appliances and How They Work,” Ron read aloud, pointedly ignoring Draco’s scoff. “Huh. Interesting.” he murmured, flipping past the hard, cardboard cover of the book and onto the first few pages, which consisted of a contents page, listing all the appliances the book covered. From then onwards, there were more drawings and sketches of the discussed machines, labels written on their parts and the respective functions. The awe in Ron’s eyes brightened exponentially as he skimmed past the book, tracing his fingers over the illustrations. 

“Ooh, a toaster.” Harry hummed, “Looks quite like my aunt’s model.” 

“I’m going to check out this book,” said Ron abruptly, looking shocked at the words spilling from his mouth. Merlin, what would Fred and George say— that Percy’s influence was really rubbing off on him— god, 

no

. With a shake of his head, the youngest Weasley boy decided that his oldest brothers were to never find out: Not even Percy, who would, no doubt, harp on for half an hour about how proud he was of his brother’s academic pursuit. 

Looking quite horrified with himself, the redhead excused himself without another word, grimacing the whole way to Madam Pince’s counter. 

“I think you just induced a whole identity crisis in Ron, Neville.” Harry remarked. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Tuesday morning came, and so did whole flocks of brown, white, and grey owls, carrying parchments in their claws and beaks, dropping them in platters of food and, if they were lucky, the receiver’s laps. One of the receivers was Hermione, who picked up the letter in confusion— confusion that quickly morphed into bubbling excitement as she hurriedly opened the letter. 

“A letter from your parents, I presume?” asked Daphne pleasantly. 

“Nope!” replied Hermione enthusiastically, ripping the letter in a suave motion with her fork, “It’s Professor Snape’s answers to my thirteen— no, I submitted two more questions on Thursday— Professor Snape’s answers to my 

fifteen 

questions.” 

“Why am I not surprised,” commented Draco dryly. 

Finals season was days away from sweeping the halls of Hogwarts full-force, and with this in mind, it was decided that the last Quidditch match of the year would be held on a weekday, instead of the typical weekends, as the first exam would be the following Monday, and students would no doubt want their Saturday and Sunday for last-minute cramming. Although Hermione greatly protested (to deaf ears), all classes on Tuesday were shortened, to make space for the match after all students were out of their classrooms. 

As it was the last game of Terrence’s schooling career, Harry had greatly insisted on the seventh year playing— and had even gone so far to, in the politest way possible, threaten to involve Professor Snape in the matter, saying that the potions master would no doubt agree with Harry’s opinion of having Terrence play. Although doubtful of the younger boy’s threat, Terrence gave in with a hearty laugh, and though no one would voice it, it was clear that the senior seeker did have some anticipation towards the very last match he would play. 

Standing in the reserves tower with Damian, Harry cheered and clapped happily for his teammates, nearly beside himself with excitement every time Slytherin scored a goal. Off the pitch, Harry was able to appreciate the game much better, without the pressing focus needed to look for the Snitch at all times. When Terrence at last pulled skilfully out of a sharp manoeuvre, Snitch clasped victoriously in his hands, Harry jumped and clapped so hard his hands would be red for days. 

In the teacher’s stand, Severus couldn’t help but smirk at Minerva’s resigned sigh— the Quidditch cup would be bearing Slytherin’s name for the eighth year in a row. In honour of their achievement, the potions master turned a blind eye to the late-night festivities down in the snakes’ common rooms, despite the fact classes would begin bright and early the next day. 

Strangely enough, the man of the hour, Terrence, was nowhere to be seen during such festivities, and while the rest of the house was slightly disappointed at his absence, they continued celebrating regardless. Most disappointed of them all was Harry, who, not five minutes later, gave into his temptation, waddling through the crowd to tug on Marcus’s sleeve. 

“Where’s Terrence?” mouthed Harry, not bothering to make an attempt to be heard over all the noise. 

For a moment, a grave expression flitted across Marcus’s eyes, and he pulled Harry out of the crowd to a quieter corner of the common room, grabbing a tart from the pile of refreshments Severus had anonymously requested the house elves to supply. 

“... You’ll find him in the Astronomy Tower,” said Marcus slowly, as if he was considering his words with every that he uttered, “... Bring this to him— if he asks, pray, don’t tell him it’s from me. Just say— well, err, just say you thought to bring him one because they looked really delicious or something. And,” the captain lingered, hesitant before he finally continued, “Harry—” 

The boy tilted his head curiously. 

Marcus opened his mouth, closed it again, and managed a rare, fond, smile, ruffling the young seeker’s dark hair. “... Just be you. That’s… exactly what Terrence needs right now.” 

Although he was not entirely comprehensive of his captain’s words, Harry did as he was told, stumbling out of the common room door and upwards, clambering through the entire height of the castle and 

finally

, the spiralling staircase of the Astronomy Tower. His footsteps were as silent as he could make them— it was eerie being alone at night, hearing the shadow of his feet echoed through stone walls. Nearing the top, Harry slowed, needing to catch his breath— and that was when he heard 

it

. 


It 

being soft, restrained sniffles, almost as if the origin was trying to smother them. 

Purposefully, Harry made his last footsteps louder, and as he rounded the corner, Terrence had just gotten his composure together, wiping the last tears from his eyes, plastering a shaky smile for Harry to see. “Oh, it’s just you, Harry.” 

The look on the seventh year could only be described as the face of someone who knew they were going to be disappointed— and was still disappointed anyway. Harry had always been rather perceptive, and if he had to put it into words, Terrence was expecting someone he knew he could 

not 

expect. 

“I brought this for you,” said Harry cheerily, revealing the carefully carried strawberry tart in his hands, “I tried some of them and they were super nice, so I thought I’d bring you one!”

Terrence wavered, staring at the tart like he’d seen a ghost instead. “I— T-Thank you, Harry. That’s… awfully nice of you.” 

Quietly, the emerald-eyed boy shuffled over to join his senior on the floor of the tower, gazing up at the stars that dusted the night sky. “You were super cool today!” Harry said at last, with all the admiration pooled in his gaze, “I really, really, 

really 

hope I could be as good as you one day! Or maybe just half as good— that’d be enough, I think.” 

A cracked laugh erupted from Terrence, holding the tart like it was the most priceless gem in the world. As he turned to face Harry, tears formed around his eyes, and out of embarrassment, the elder turned away, knowing without a doubt that Harry had seen them. 

“You just always know what to say, huh.” said Terrence absent-mindedly, “... You know, for an eleven-year-old, you’re a lot more perceptive than plenty of others older than you.” 

They sat in silence for a little while longer, and Terrence nibbled on his tart, as if he were trying to appreciate every single crumb of it. 

“... The team will be in good hands, Harry.” breathed the seventh year, unable to resist from ruffling the younger boy’s hair— there was just something about Harry’s dark, messy locks that made them irresistible. “Give us nine years in a row, you hear me?” 

Harry grinned. “I’ll try.” 

A comfortable silence descended among them once more, until it was broken by a shy shuffling. Terrence looked over questioningly, and upon his gaze, Harry flushed until he was all snuggled by his senior’s side, wordlessly leaning into the older boy’s warmth. It was at this point Terrence’s composure, which had been up to that point held together by fine threads, finally broke apart, a choked sob writhing its way from his throat. 

Harry sat wordlessly, offering all he had to give: a small, warm company. 

In Terrence’s memories, a girl smiled brightly down at him, her eyes containing the same genuine, innocent spark that Harry’s gaze held. Laughter bubbled from her throat as she ran down the hallways, hand clasping his as she urged him on, Filch’s furious yells miles away from where they were, in their happy little bubble, where even detention in Snape’s dungeon seemed insignificant compared to all they were to each other. Pride shone in her eyes as she cheered, jumping up and down in the stands as Terrence hovered in the air, hand held high to show the captured Snitch. Adoration, as she looked up at him, golden curls a mess as she sat across a library table, knowing very well that Terrence was doing his very best to appear focused, eyes trailing distractedly over his Charms textbook. 


“Hiding up here again, Mr. Star Seeker?” Her teasing tone wafted through the air as she finally joined him on the floor of the Astronomy Tower. Somewhere far, far, below them, the Slytherins were celebrating yet another Quidditch victory. “How pompous. The man of the hour refuses to join the festivities.” 



Fifth-year Terrence couldn’t help but roll his eyes good-naturedly. “Oh, so I’m the pompous one? When they’re the ones who yelled slurs at me in the corridors, threw hexes over their shoulders, insulted my mother in front of me— and the moment I start winning Quidditch for them, it’s all ‘Oh we love Terrence, he’s great, the finest seeker we’ve ever had’.” 



Her giggle made Terrence’s sarcastic smile morph into a loving one. “Geez, no need to get so riled up. Here, snatched you a tart from downstairs.” 



“... Well,” the seeker cleared his throat, staring at the slightly squashed strawberry tart she had smuggled for him. “... Not much, but I suppose—” 



“Beggars can’t be choosers.” she interrupted, wagging a finger at him seriously until she couldn’t hold in her laughter. “Why can’t you learn to be thankful once? Ungrateful brat.” 



“Oh, alright, alright,” Rolling his eyes in good humour, Terrence smiled, leaning forward to brush off a stray crumb from Morgan’s face, “Look at you. All pureblood breeding this, pureblood breeding that, and you can’t even eat properly. How shall you ever find a husband like this?” 



Another bright, firework display of her infectious laughter. “Just shut up and eat your tart!” 



He grinned, tugging her closer until she was snuggled up against his side, shushing her protests with a “You’re going to start sneezing in five minutes, and Merlin forbid you get a cold— what shall we do when Professor Snape questions why you’ve gone down sick when you should’ve been all warm down in the commons—” 


“... Thank you, Harry.”

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────
 “Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”  

 “Stand aside, you silly girl… stand aside, now…”  

 “Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead—” 
A piercing scream shot through Harry like a bullet, jotting him awake. He sat upright in his bed, glancing around the dormitory wildly. It took him a minute to assess the situation— he was in the Slytherin dorms, the Black Lake reflected in the large, full length glass panes that measured the height of the room. The rest of his yearmates were sound asleep, save for Theodore, who had stirred at the noise and was staring at him blearily from the next bed. “Harry?” murmured the other boy, squinting at him in the darkness. “Yeah.” “... Everything alright?” There was a weird sort of understanding in Theodore’s grey eyes, even in the dim light of the room. Something about the other dark-haired boy just seemed to reflect bits and pieces of Harry, similar yet dissimilar experiences shining from their past. “... Yeah.” Harry said, not quite sure of his answer. “Just… had that dream again.”Wordlessly, Theodore shuffled over, bed sheets rustling as he helped himself onto Harry’s bed, tucking both of them in under the covers. “... Want to talk about it?” “Nah.” shrugged Harry, snuggling closer to the lankier boy. It had been their practice, as of late, to share a bed, when one or the other sat awake in the darkness of the night, woken by nightmares annoyingly plagued them more often in the period of final exams. An invisible bond had formed between them since Christmas, and as far as eleven-year-olds are concerned, “It was the same one.” “Green light?” “Yeah.” “... There were more… details this time, though.” added Harry as an afterthought, “Like the… edges of the dream were  clearer , if that makes sense.” It probably didn’t make sense, but Theodore entertained him anyway. “Maybe you’re getting more creative with your nightmares,” grinned the other, stifling a laugh as Harry angled his head to glare at him. “Hey, it’s a compliment.” “I hate this,” Harry pouted, “It’s awful, I get the same thing  every night  — there’s no originality, really— and I can’t even focus when it’s daytime and I’m  actually  supposed to be awake. Yesterday afternoon, at the library with ‘Mione, I stared at the same page of Professor FIltwick’s revision notes for  thirty minutes .” “How absurd and inconsiderate of your brain to not let you concentrate.” Theodore nodded solemnly. “I say, you must raise this complaint to Professor Snape. This behaviour will not be tolerated in the House of Slytherin.” Harry glared. “But honestly, it could be a good idea to talk to Professor Snape. He could probably give you something for the dreams if they’re really affecting your concentration.” The other boy shifted, tugging the covers so that it covered the both of them. “... I could go with you to see him, if you’d like.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Although Theodore had kindly offered, Harry insisted that he would be fine. He left for the professor’s office right after their last class, waving goodbye to Hermione, Theodore, and a reluctant Draco, who would be heading off to the library for  some more revision. As a stress-leaving activity, Hermione had drafted revision schedules for everyone, and was coaxing their entire friend group into following the schedule strictly. Halfway down to the dungeons, Harry bit back a hiss, feeling his scar throb in pulses of pain. Not too far away, he could hear a couple third-years doing last minute practices for their Defence exams. Beneath the yells and hollers of defence spells, Harry could hear Professor Quirrel’s shaky, unassuring remarks: “G-Good job, e-everyone, k-k-keep it up…” Rubbing at his temple, Harry tried his very best to ignore the pain, making a mental note to raise the issue to Professor Snape, however ridiculous it sounded—  Hi professor, my lightning-shaped scar that I supposingly got from a car crash from my supposingly drunk parents hurts sometimes, do you have any remedy that could make that go away? Thanks . “Come in.” drawled the professor, clearly expecting a seventh year panicking about their exams. “Mr. Potter,” he said, with mild surprise, “How may I be of assistance?” “Good evening, Professor.” Harry replied politely, feeling shy now that he was standing in the office before the older Slytherin’s desk. “Um… I… I’ve been having… dreams.” Professor Snape blinked. “... That is a perfectly common occurrence, Mr. Potter.” he said slowly. “Yes, but—” Harry swallowed thickly, “... It’s the same dream every night. I… I hear a woman screaming. A-And, she’s always— she’s always saying—” “Take your time, Mr. Potter.” Professor Snape sounded unusually gentle. “S-She’s always s-saying,” Harry took a deep breath, already feeling tears pricking his eyelids, “She’s saying, ‘Not Harry, not Harry, please— please not Harry’, and— and there’s this— this man, he tells her to— to step aside, and she, she keeps begging, and there’s a flash—” He’d never really  cried  when he spoke about his dream to Theodore, who was well-versed with the story now— but now that he was standing before his professor, his tears just kept coming, and hiccups interrupted his breaths, the corpses of his words piling up in his throat, drowning out his words. Hastily, he removed his glasses, desperately wiping at his tears, hoping his professor wasn’t staring at him in  disgust . “Take it easy, Harry.” Professor Snape’s voice was much closer than he’d expected, startling the boy. A long arm wrapped itself around his back, and then Harry was being pulled into an embrace, surrounded by a thick, black cloth smelling of dried potion ingredients and old books. Unable to help himself, Harry continued sniffling away, tears trailing down his cheeks until they finally smushed against the older man’s shirt. It was a while before anyone spoke again. In the silence, Harry registered a few things— his professor flicking a hand at the door, a resounding, locking  click echoing through the chambers, and the rustling of heavy, cloak-like material until he was wrapped warmly in them. Only then did Harry realise he had descended into the dungeons in only his white button shirt, his sweater discarded on his bed down at the dorms. “Done?” “Y-Yeah.” Harry drew back, embarrassment painted across his face. “... I’m sorry.” he mumbled, eyeing the darker spots of his tears on Severus’s garments. “I’m assuming you’re here because you can’t concentrate on your studies, yes?” Professor Snape got straight to the point, saving the younger boy from any further humiliation. “I can give you a couple vials of Dreamless Sleep— I hope you haven’t been slacking off  that much, Mr. Potter, surely you know what they are?” The boy nodded. “And you must also know that they are addictive?” Severus questioned, collecting a few vials of pale blue liquid from his desk drawer, “Not more than a vial a night, Mr. Potter.” Harry took them thankfully, still too ashamed to look his head of house in the eye. “Now, this isn’t a long-term solution.” The potions master continued, “Perhaps after your exams, we could… set up some other… help for you.” Although he wasn’t much too keen on retelling his dreams of his mother’s death to anyone else, Harry nodded stiffly, pocketing the vials delicately. “Yes, professor.” he mumbled. “Mr. Potter, look at me.” Professor Snape spoke, quiet but firm. When at last Harry’s soft, Lily-like gaze met his, the former Death Eater had to make a mental effort to steel himself, seeing the ghost of a friend in his first-year snake. “I may be busy these few days, but I want you to understand that you are to come to my office whenever you need it, understand? Even if it’s in the middle of the night— mind, don’t make a ruckus and wake up half the castle on your way down.” “Yes, sir.” “I am your Head of House, Mr. Potter. It is within my job scope to care for your well-being, and that includes your mental well-being. Understood?” Even though Harry hadn’t had a full night’s worth of sleep in days, he managed a small smile. “Yes, sir.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Severus was  thinking . He knew that it was technically illegal to use Legilimency on any student, not to mention  eleven-year-old  students— but when Harry met his gaze, a sea of unknown lingering under the emerald surface, Severus pressed gently, like dipping a finger into a still lake. To his greatest surprise, there was  resistance — resistance, like the boy was practised with occlumency. 
 Since when was Harry Potter an occlumens?  
To be fair, the boy had survived the killing curse. Him being a natural occlumens would not be too far a possibility. All things considered, however, he was  still  an eleven-year-old, and how much practice would eleven-year-olds have with legilimency, anyway— Severus rethought this on the basis that one of the Wizarding World’s most famous legilimens, Albus Dumbledore, was the principal of their school, and that the other, the Dark Lord, had attempted to murder the boy and  failed  . Okay, so maybe Harry had  quite the number of altercations with powerful legilimens. Still.He was a child. Severus pressed, firmer, against the lake surface, and to his immense surprise, the lake surface…  investigated him. The water body came alive, forming a blob that circled his hand, scrutinised his palm and trailed over his fingers, until it finally returned back to the main body, making the lake still again. It was as if nothing happened. And then the lake rose and enveloped him whole. Severus gasped, his skin feeling cool from the temperature of the water body around him. The lake had  come alive  — it had a mind of its own, and it acted  exactly  like an occlumens barrier would have, except it seemed to have a soul of its own instead of being an extension of the occlumens’ mind. There were so many implications with everything he had just seen, but Severus shelved it away for more  thinking  ,  later . When the world around him— he would assume he was beneath the lake— came into focus again, it formed a scene, a scene that he quickly recognised and  dreaded . Unlike normal memories, where he could stand at the side and watch the story unfold, the one in Harry’s… lake was viewed through someone’s eyes. Severus, from the unknown point of view, strutted down the street of Godric Hollow, a clear destination in mind. Raising a wand, he flicked it powerfully, sending the front door crashing into the living room behind. 
 “Lily, take Harry and go!”  
James Potter stared at him defiantly, with more anger in his eyes than Severus had ever witnessed. Severus couldn’t help but  sneer — who did James Potter think he was, facing him off without a wand— It hit Severus. He wasn’t  Severus  in the memory. A voice rumbled from his chest, even though Severus’s throat was too frozen to form a coherent sentence. James Potter stopped, all movement robbed of him, and if it wasn’t  that day, Severus might’ve found it comical. Hazel eyes glassed over, and without another word, James Potter fell over, eternally motionless until the end of time. Severus could feel a disgusted snarl crawl across his lips as he stepped over the body and approached the stairs, where he could already hear a woman trying her very best to soothe the child in her arms, although she might be reassuring  herself , too. The stairs creaked under him as he ascended them, one step at a time, with all the time in the world, as if he knew that he had already won, as if he knew that there was nothing anyone could do to stop him. He hadn’t seen Lily’s face in years. Eleven years, to be exact. 
 “Not Harry, not Harry, please, not Harry—” 
Severus tugged on his occlumens barrier, pulling it around himself like a cloak. He would not care. He would not feel. He would  not . Pulling out of the memory felt like rising from a pool of icy water. Forcing himself to refocus, Severus stared back into the eyes of Harry Potter, and it was almost as if no time had passed, from when he started pressing against the lake surface. “I am your Head of House, Mr. Potter,” Severus spoke, clenching his fist behind his back. He would  not let his voice shake. “It is within my job scope to care for your well-being, and that includes your mental well-being. Understood?” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────
 Why the bloody fuck was Dark Lord’s memory of 31st October implanted in Harry Potter’s mind?  

 Why the fuck was Harry-bloody-Potter an occlumens, and a rather accomplished one at that?  

 Why the fuck did the bloody Sorting Hat leave Lily’s child in his house, leaving him his to care for, his to worry about, his to lose sleep over— 
Severus gritted his teeth, having been rolling around over and over in his bed for the past— he checked his bedside clock—  two hours ? Deciding he wasn’t getting any sleep soon, the professor stumbled out of bed grumpily, promising himself that he was going to rain  hell on his incompetent fifth-year potion students the next morning. He had a million questions, and all of them stemmed from the one and only Harry Potter. Perhaps he was starting to understand why Ms. Granger spent so much time in the library now. Ripping a random parchment from his desk, Severus began jotting down, in his worst handwriting (it was  three in the morning , could you blame him), all the questions he would have to follow up with research. 
Why does Harry Potter have Dark Lord’s memory implanted in him? 
How is Harry Potter an occlumens? 
How does Harry Potter’s occlumens barrier have a mind of his own? 
Severus sighed, leaning back into his chair. He hadn’t thought that anything could be more mentally draining than marking fifty seventh-year potion essays, but Harry Potter had proved him wrong. Tapping his quill on the table, the potions master started the mark out topics of interest, topics that could lead to a big, big conclusion, and when he had finally finished, he stared at the question that could be the answer of them all. 
 How did Harry survive a killing curse?  
There was not much research and information on the killing curse, given that most who were cursed by it never lived to tell the story. And the  one person who lived to tell the story was much too young to remember anything— except— except— The Dark Lord was definitely old enough to remember. Holding his wand to his temple, Severus sucked in a breath, gently drawing out the silvery memory of himself watching 31st October beneath Harry’s lake. Fingering through his desk for a vial, he found an empty one at last, and hovered the stringy substance into the glass bottle. He watched it curiously for a moment, tapping on the walls of the vial, as if that would give him the answers he needed. As far as anyone knew, the Dark Lord’s corpse was never found. He would know— he had been the first on scene at the Potters, after the house was blasted apart by a green light that blinded the entire street. The Dark Lord disappeared. Or maybe he didn’t. Severus tapped his finger on his desk, fumbling with the laws of magic as he knew it.Was it possible that the Dark Lord had somehow… embedded his soul into Harry’s…? ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

On Hermione’s insistence, Professor Filtwick had agreed to have a last 

last 

revisional class on Sunday afternoon before their written and practical exam on Monday. Of course, Hermione being Hermione, she’d made Harry, Theodore, and Draco attend the extra class as well, placating Theodore’s complaints about having to wake early with top grades in the whole year.

“We’ll go back first, ‘Mione,” Harry had told the Muggleborn, who’d stayed back to ask the professor a few more questions. The class had dragged on for a little longer than it should’ve, cutting into lunch hour. Draco had started whining about how hungry he was, and that having lunch at a later interval than usual would cause him to put on weight, and Theodore, who usually helped shut Draco up, was too grumpy and sleep-deprived to contribute. 

Harry shepherded his two friends down the corridors towards the Great Hall, where he was sure the prospect of food would rouse the two from their moods. 

They got distracted (as always). 

It was a pretty good damn reason to get distracted, however. As they passed Professor Quirrel’s garlic-smelling classroom, Harry’s scar started throbbing, more painful than ever, but he bit his lip and swallowed the pain in favour of what they heard: 

“I’m sorry, master, please— please forgive me,” Quirrel whimpered pitifully, sounding like he was getting tortured, “Please forgive me, master, I have not been competent—” 

The defence professor wailed quietly, sounding as if he was in pain. Despite the pulses of pain from his forehead, Harry felt a twinge of pity for the man. 

“Master— please— please spare me, I promise, I promise— yes, yes I will, I promise you, master…” 

“Go, go!” hissed Theodore, shoving Draco across the corridor so they wouldn’t be in Quirrel’s line of sight as he exited the classroom. Luckily for them, they managed to duck behind the corner just before the defence professor opened the door shakily, his arms trembling like his nerve ends were fried. “Let’s wait to see who comes out after him.” 

Food was apparently less important than sticking their noses in matters that didn’t involve them. This was something that both Theodore and Draco could agree on. 

“I sincerely hope you aren’t getting up to any trouble.” 

The three snakes jumped, different levels of fright etched on their faces, as Professor Snape approached them, silent as a viper, from the back. He eyed each of them— Draco, who looked like Bloody Baron had just walked through him; Harry, who looked embarrassed at getting caught, and Theodore, who was completely unbothered once he got over the initial shock. 

“Certainly not,” Theodore answered smoothly, “We had just heard Professor Quirrel whimpering in the classroom, and in worry for our beloved professor, stuck around to see who had been threatening him.” 

Professor Snape raised an eyebrow. 

“This classroom?” 

Theodore nodded with an innocent smile. “Yes, sir.” 

Without hesitation, Professor Snape knocked and sauntered into the room, only the tip of his wand visible, the rest concealed by his long sleeves. In character to their curiosity, the three snakes scrambled to stand behind their professor to find— 

An empty classroom. 

“Interesting,” hummed the professor, arching an eyebrow, thinly-veiled threat behind his eyes. “Mr. Nott, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, if this was a prank of some sort, well, I expected better quality work from you three, despite Ms. Granger’s brilliant intelligence missing from your little trio—” 

“We swear, professor, we heard Professor Quirrel in here,” Harry insisted, wincing at another flare of pain. 

“He was saying things like, like,” Draco fumbled to back up their argument, “Err, ‘Master, please forgive me’, and, and, ‘Please spare me,’—” 

Professor Snape arched his eyebrow once more, raising it impossible high. “Thank you for the… excellent reenactment, Mr. Malfoy, but—” 

It was at that moment Harry collapsed. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“His scar has been hurting and 

not a single one of you 

thought to tell me?” Severus hissed, pacing before Harry’s bed in the infirmary. Across the room, Madam Pomfrey was soaking another cloth in icy water, to replace the one that was currently doing its very best to cool Harry’s burning forehead. 

“He said he was going to tell you,” Theodore defended fiercely, lowering his voice, “When he went to you about his nightmares.” 

Halting his pacing, Severus recalled the previous day— Harry had cried in his office, describing briefly the contents of his dream, and after he had calmed down, Severus had given him a couple vials of Dreamless Sleep, and caught up in the shock of everything he’d seen in Harry’s head, didn’t think to ask if there was anything else before the boy left. Cursing under his breath, the potions master glowered at himself, engaging in his relentless pacing once more. 

“Ms. Granger, if you could kindly help me replace the washcloth,” Poppy said kindly, shooting an intervening look at Severus’s direction, exasperated his antics, “And Severus, if you could stop that bothersome pacing and 

sit down

 or make yourself helpful, we’d all greatly appreciate it.” 

“How long has the scar thing been bothering him?” Severus asked sharply, too worried to feel a twinge of annoyance when Theodore glared back at him, equally sharp. 

“Since the school year began.” Theodore answered, bristling. “He said he first felt the pain at the opening feast— he said he looked at you and his scar felt like someone slit it open with a small knife.” 

Severus fell silent. “He looked at me?” 

“And throughout the rest of the year,” Theodore continued, ignoring his professor’s question, “It especially has a tendency to hurt during Quirrel’s classes,” Severus was too preoccupied trying to piece the information together to correct Theodore with a ‘

Professor 

Quirrel, Mr. Nott’, not that the nervous man deserved the 

professor 

title, anyway— “but he keeps attributing that to the garlic.” 

“Only Harry bloody Potter would attribute his scar hurting to 

garlic

.” Ron snorted, trying to liven the mood. “What, is his scar allergic to garlic? Is his scar a vampire?” 

“We were outside Professor Quirrel’s classroom when Harry fainted, too.” Draco observed quietly. 

“And he’s the one who cursed Harry’s broom.” Hermione bristled. 

Madam Pomfrey cleared her throat, “Fellow Slytherins, as much as I may or may not agree with your accusations, let’s apply some subtlety and keep that to ourselves, or for discussion in 

closed 

quarters and certainly 

not 

in the infirmary, where 

anyone 

may enter at any time.” 

“Madam Pomfrey’s a Slytherin?” Ron went through five stages of shock as the mediwitch walked away, to get more washcloths for Harry’s still-running fever. His temperature was rising through the roof, and he was going through stacks of ice-cold cloths without a single drop in his body heat. 

“Regarding Harry’s first bout of scar-pain,” Theodore spoke quietly, “I think that was a false alarm. If I recall correctly…” 

“Professor Quirrel sat beside Professor Snape at the feast,” Hermione concluded, eyes bright as she replaced another washcloth on Harry’s forehead. “Harry may have seen Quirrel 

past 

you instead, professor.” 

The dark-haired Nott heir nodded. “It’s very possible.” 

“Plus, Harry’s scar always hurts more when Quirrel’s back is facing him,” Hermione added, “Whenever, er, 

Professor 

Quirrel turns around to write on the board, Harry immediately ducks his head down.”

Severus paused. “Quirrel’s 

back 

makes Mr. Potter’s scar hurt.” 

“As ridiculous as that sounds,” Theodore pursed his lips, “Yes.”  

“Interesting.” 

“What’s interesting?” mumbled Harry, squinting at everyone gathered around his bed. “... ‘Mione, that you?” 

“Has your fever made you 

dumb

, Potter?” Draco snorted. “It’s clearly Granger. Who else has hair 

that 

wild?” 

“No, he can’t see, you 

idiot

.” Theodore swatted. “‘Mione, his 

glasses

.” 

“How long was I out?” Harry fiddled with his glasses, “And why is my shirt wet?” 

“Four hours,” Theodore supplied helpfully, “And because you went through twenty washcloths per hour for your burning forehead. Pretty sure we could’ve cooked an egg on your head.” 

“

Four hours

?” Harry’s eyes bulged out from their sockets, “I haven’t finished going through my revision material for Charms—” 

“Mr. Potter, you fainted and was unconscious for four hours. Charms should not be on your top list of worries at the moment.” interrupted Severus dryly, “If it makes you feel any better, however, Fillius has been raving about how much of your mother’s talent you inherited for the entire year— mind you, she was his best student in 

years

. You are going to be perfectly fine, 

if 

only you 

rest 

and follow the rest of Madam Pomfrey’s orders.” 

As if she had heard her name, the mediwitch hurried up, checking Harry’s temperature with a quick diagnostic spell. “Oh, wonderful,” she breathed happily, “Your temperature’s more or less back to normal now, Mr. Potter— drink this, your body’s exhausted from fighting your fever— if your temperature stays low for the entire night, I’ll approve you to go for your Charms exam.” 

“There is a possibility of me missing the exam?” Harry looked like a kicked puppy. 

“Well, you can't sit for the paper if you’re burning up and unconscious, can you?” Poppy crossed her arms. “All you’ve got to do is drink lots of water and 

sleep well

, Mr. Potter.” 

“But—” 

“No buts, Mr. Potter.” Severus gave him a stern look. “You 

will 

behave for Madam Pomfrey, or I shall refuse to mark your potions paper and you 

will 

receive an 

ungraded

.” 

Harry opened his mouth and closed it again. 

“I’ll have the elves send up dinner for them, if that’s alright with you, Poppy?” Severus asked curtly. 

“Yes, but you lot will have to leave when I say so.” Poppy directed a no-nonsense look at the rest of the first-years. “Mr. Potter needs his rest, 

especially 

if he wants to sit for his Charms exam tomorrow.” 

The group of children chorused their (reluctant) agreements, and the two adults walked away, out of hearing range. 

“Never thought I’d live to see a student genuinely 

faint 

the day before exams and not be overjoyed about it.” Poppy murmured, “That’s Lily’s son, alright. If he didn’t have the looks, I’d doubt he was James’s.” 

Severus snorted. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Luckily for Severus’s blood pressure, the rest of exam week passed without much fuss. Of course, after every exam, Hermione would interrogate every single one of them on their answers: 

What had you put for question two, ‘Name two identifiers of the Foghorn Plant’

, or 

Which essay topic had you chosen, I picked ‘Effect of Draught of Living Death in combination with boils remedy’.


“For the love of Merlin, Granger,” Theodore grumbled as they left the exam hall after their last paper— the written portion of the Transfiguration exam. “Let it go.” 

In celebration of their exams ending (and in an effort to keep Hermione from losing her mind to 

worry

), the first-years decided to spend the rest of their days roaming the grounds. The flying lessons had been abruptly cancelled after the incident of the first class (Neville’s fall), and so Hermione never really learned how to fly, which incited an entire outrage from Draco, who couldn’t imagine a life without 

flying

. 

“You’re a witch, Granger,” Draco argued, “Doesn’t Muggle culture constantly portray witches as people on 

brooms

? How can you be a proper witch if you can’t fly?” 

More surprising than Draco’s knowledge of Muggle representation was the fact Hermione 

agreed 

to let her friends teach her flying, on the condition that they were all practised with a cushioning charm and would catch her if she fell. Harry pulled a couple strings, 

politely 

asking Marcus if they could borrow some brooms from the Quidditch team, and of course, how could Marcus ever say no to those puppy eyes? 

Their Transfiguration paper had been early Friday morning, and it just so happened that Friday afternoon was warm yet cooling— the perfect day for a first fly. After a quick stop to the broom shed, the group was off, traipsing down the meadows in bliss, watching the older years (who still had exams for the next two weeks or so) glare at them in envy. 

“Ready?” Ron grinned, situating Hermione on her broom. Above them, Harry was already circling the air, ready to catch Hermione if she fell. Theodore was seated comfortably on the grass, twirling his wand between his fingers, prepared to cast a cushioning charm at a moment’s notice. 

“No!” Hermione protested, feeling terrified now. 

“You’re going to be fine,” Ron assured, “You’ve got star seeker, Mr. Potter over there, who has the fastest broom in the industry and even faster reflexes. You’ve also got Mr. Nott, charms extraordinaire. You’re going to be fine, Hermione, relax.” 

Shakily, the Muggleborn agreed, and gently kicked off the ground, gripping the broom like it was her lifeline. 

“Don’t grip too hard,” Harry advised, swooping over to fly by her, his hand steadying her broom. “Imagine it’s a live animal— a horse, maybe— I’ve never rode a horse before, but imagine that the broom has its own feelings. Just be gentle 

but 

firm with it. You’re in charge, and make the broom know that.” 

“How do I make a broom know I’m in charge?” Hermione yelped. 

It took a while, but the girl eventually got a hang of flying, and started to enjoy the feeling of the wind in her hair. Ron, Draco, and Theodore joined them in the skies as well, while Neville— well, he was still a tad bit traumatised from the last time he flew. Using a transfigured moss ball, they played dumbed-down-Quidditch for an hour or so, Neville acting as referee on the plains below. 

When at last they trudged back to the castle, everyone was sweaty, tired, but brimming with serotonin. Hermione even managed to admit that flying wasn’t so bad, and she could see why 

boys 

were obsessed with it (Theodore made an insulted face here)— just a little bit. Worn out with all the exercise, the first years sleepily crawled their way into the Great Hall, mumbling softly to the conversation around them. On the staff table, Severus couldn’t help but hide a small smile behind his cup— while invigilating a written Herbology paper that afternoon, he had caught a glimpse of the first years out on the fields. Initially, he had wanted to flop over the meadows in a rage, reprimanding the group for unsupervised flying— but who was he kidding really? They’d ended up perfectly fine, of course, and he’d kept his eye on them through the afternoon. 

“I hate chess.” Hermione grumbled down at the Slytherin common room later that day, after losing her fifth match in a row. She’d played Daphne first, that was a sure defeat— then Draco, Theodore, and Harry 

twice

. 

“Your playing is too rushed,” Theodore commented eloquently, his knight yelling triumphantly as it took down Draco’s bishop. Across the table, the blonde yelled in frustration until Daphne shot a polite yet 

scathing 

look in his direction. “Take your time, Hermione, and 

open your eyes

. Harry’s an 

atrocious 

player and he still managed to pull off two ambushes on you.” 

“Hey!” protested Harry. “Atrocious is a rather strong word, don’t you think?” 

As with all eleven year olds, the group had an absurdly 

short 

attention span. They still had one and a half weeks to wait out as the older years completed their exams, and had exhausted most of their ideas to spend the rest of their school days. Theodore, on a boring afternoon, had suggested they take a 

harmless 

walk around the castle grounds. Hogwarts was millennia old and had housed Merlin knew how many students— surely, there would be interest-captivating things among its ancient halls. 

“If we do run into Professor Snape, we’ll just say we’re taking a walk to stretch our legs, that's all.” Ron assured Hermione for the millionth time. He had been the biggest supporter of Theodore’s suggestion, and immediately ushered the group out of the library— which had become their hanging spot, as common rooms were out of the question. 

“That sounds believable.” Harry snorted. 

“G-Guys…?” Neville stuttered, having lagged towards the back of the group. The rest of the first years had rounded the corner, leaving the Gryffindor behind the bend by himself, unseen by his peers. 

“Longbottom, for the love of Merlin, could you stubby legs walk any faster,” Draco huffed, backtracking to grab the lion, “We’ve got a whole afternoon and 

so much 

of the castle to see, Father wouldn’t tell me where any of the secret passages were and I want to find at least 

one

…” 

“... Really? How interesting.” Professor Snape hummed, Neville’s terrified gaze still pinpointed on him. “Do continue, Mr. Malfoy.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“You’re getting 

first years 

to brew potions for my infirmary?” Poppy blinked, wide-eyed and in disbelief. “Severus Snape, what happened to your insanely-high quality control standards?” 

“They are 

not 

insanely-high, Poppy, you’re exaggerating.” Severus corrected, slightly annoyed at her assessment of him, “And they’re only brewing the simplest of the simplest brews. I’ve got to keep them occupied 

somehow

, Merlin knows they’ll be two feet deep in trouble the moment I take my eyes off them.” 

“Still!” 

“I 

will 

check all the work they produce before sending them up to you.” The potions master continued, “Merlin knows those brats will slack off during the summer and forget everything I’ve thought— they need all the practice they can get before the holidays,” Severus said distastefully, as if the idea of 

summer 

had personally offended him. “And all the ingredients they’re using are bought with the school budget— like 

hell 

I’d let them near my personal stores— 

plus

, those ingredients will rot soon, and I’ve already set aside all the ingredients the upper years are using in their practical exams. It’s a win-win situation.” 

“I cannot believe you, Severus Snape.” Poppy shook her head, laughter starting to work itself out of her throat. At the man’s quizzical look, she laughed even louder: “One year with them and you’ve become a totally different man! Merlin, look at you.” 

He scowled. “I can hardly fathom what you mean, Poppy. I’m the same man.” 

“Keep telling yourself that!” 

Annoyed at her cryptic words, Severus stomped out of the infirmary, although there was no real bite in his stomping. The mediwitch was beside herself, humour wrinkling her eyes. Somewhere inside his cold, fortified soul, Severus had found the room to care about six first years— and one third of those eleven-year-olds weren’t even his snakes! From what she’d heard from Pomona, the Slytherin professor had arranged for the two lions to spend the rest of their afternoons at the greenhouses, too, under the guise of the Herbology professor needing Mr. Longbottom’s expertise at caring for her exotic plants, and Mr. Weasley’s newfound talent around Herbology-related machines. 

Of course, Severus being Severus, the cold, resident dungeon bat of Hogwarts corridors, he had to come up with excuses— keeping the first-years out of trouble, yes, using up ingredients that would otherwise start to rot and expire… 

“Merlin help us all,” Poppy giggled to no one in particular, “Severus Snape’s gone 

soft

.”

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────


Quirrel’s been quiet lately

, Severus mused to himself, giving one of his fourth years a generous 60%. Across his work bench, four of his first-year snakes were busying away in one of his empty potion classrooms, brewing four separate batches of stress reliever. Poppy had upper years barging into the infirmary every half an hour, grabbing the relievers by 

dozens 

as they slaved away for the final few papers. 

And the protection charms have been undisturbed, too

. 

With the recent developments, which consisted majorly of Harry’s scar-induced fever, Severus had gathered the rest of the castle’s staff for a No-Dumbledore-allowed meeting, where they agreed unanimously to increase the wards around Cerberus’s chamber. Of course, Quirrell was not informed of this meeting, and therefore, was unaware of the additional protections added. 

“There’s another batch.” Hermione tapped the quill against her cheek, mentally calculating the amount of reliever they’d produced. Theodore, Harry, and Draco gathered around her, peering over her shoulder at the numbers she’d jotted down on her clipboard. “That’s… 56 litres, divided by 0.7 litres— 80 bottles of reliever!” 

“Good job.” Severus hummed, making a mental note of how many fourth year students would be qualified for his NEWT level classes the next year. “There’s still sufficient time before lunch to brew one more batch of…” he eyed the list Poppy had sent him, consisting of all the potions she was low on. “Calming draught, perhaps?” 

It didn’t take long for the snakes to get back to work, scurrying around his lab, gathering the ingredients they would need, grabbing scales and balances from the shelf to accurately measure out the portions required. Severus turned his attention back to his work, crossly circling the 

ridiculous 

content his students spouted back to him in their exam essay. Had none of his students listened during class? Who the 

hell

 had he been lecturing to?


Ring

. 

Severus sat up straight with alertness. He waited for the alarm once more, and it came— 

Ring.

 Unceremoniously, he shoved the remaining exam papers together and shot the first-years a stern glare. 

“I will be right back.” he informed briskly, “If anything explodes, 

duck

, and if anything spills, 

exsugat spongia 

should do the trick. If anyone gets hurt, get the nearest professor or a seventh year. Do 

not 

leave this room, unless there is an emergency. Understood?” 

“Yes, sir.” they chorused. Satisfied, Severus swept out of the room, murmuring protection spells to latch onto the door. Only the professors (excluding Quirrell and Dumbledore, 

obviously

) and Severus’s most trusted snakes, which consisted of Terrence, Marcus, and several other prefects, would be allowed to pass the entrance into the classroom. As long as his first-years remained inside, as he had instructed, they would be safe. 

At the moment, he would focus his mind on one issue and one issue only. 

The third floor corridor had been breached. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“How kind of you to join us, Severus.” Poppy greeted easily as the potions master stormed into the corridor. Minerva and Fillius were already gathered by Cerberus’s door, and Severus would assume that Pomona was invigilating and couldn’t leave the students unattended. 

“Shall we?” Fillius’s eyes gleamed as he readied his wand. 

On Minerva’s count of three, they blasted the door open, greeted by the slobbering faces of the Ceberus. Fillius shot a well-aimed charm at the harp by the creature’s foot, and instantly, Debussy’s Clair de Lune filled the air. One, two, then three of the Cerberus’s heads were swaying to the music, and half a minute later, the three-headed-dog was sound asleep, its dreams filled with Debussy. 

“I hate that thing.” Severus commented, lip curling. 

“I think we can all agree on that.” Poppy murmured, stepping over one of the dog’s large feet. “Minerva, the trapdoor?” 

The Head of Gryffindor wasted no time, levitating the trapdoor so the mediwitch could shoot a ball of blue fire at the writhing plant below. Hissing angrily, the Devil’s Snare retreated away from the warmth, clearing the way for the professors. 

“Ah, one of my favourite spells.” hummed Severus in appreciation, gleefully remembering how Hermione had set Quirrell on fire with absolutely no remorse. That girl was one of his snakes, alright. 

It wasn’t long before they found Quirrell, a pathetic mess of a professor— looking equal parts exhausted and terrified at being discovered. The defence teacher didn’t even try— he was outnumbered one to four, each of which were among the best wixen Hogwarts had ever produced. 

“Dear me, Quirinus!” Filius exclaimed, making an overly-exaggerated face of surprise, “What in Merlin’s name are you doing here?” 

“Struggling, clearly.” Severus remarked dryly. Quirrell was trembling from head to toe, surrounded by a flurry of flying keys, attempting to stun the correct one. He had gotten weaker through the months— to the point he couldn’t keep his wand arm steady enough to fire a sure 

stupefy

. Severus, on the other hand, was 

perfectly 

healthy and 

perfectly 

capable of a well-aimed stunning spell. “

Stupefy

.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Well,” Fillius said cheerfully. They were gathered in Severus’s office, Quirrell magically bound to a chair Minerva had transfigured from a piece of fractured wood, the man’s head hung low as he discreetly flicked his gaze from one colleague to another, looking immensely tired and terrified. “Crisis averted— the curse on the defence position continues.” 

With a quick flick of her wand, Minerva reversed Severus’s stunning spell, giving the defence professor her coldest glare. “Would you like to explain yourself, Quirinus?” 

“Y-Yes, I-I-I can explain, I-I promise,” stuttered Quirinus, words spilling out of his mouth now that he was verbal again. “T-This is all a misunderstanding, M-Minerva, s-surely you d-don’t think I w-would attempt to steal the s-stone, would y-you? I would n-never dare…” 

“And yet,” Severus cut in, eyes ablaze with murderous intent, “You 

dared 

to jinx my seeker’s broom in broad daylight.” 

This was news to Minerva and Fillius, who looked like they’d been told the shock of their lives once the weight of the truth sank in. “Hold on now, Severus— you’re saying that Quirinus was the one who— who attempted to throw young Mr. Potter off his broom?” 

“Correct,” The potions master sneered, “And you were stopped by an eleven-year-old girl, no less— how pathetic, to be outwitted by someone 

half 

your age.”


“Silence!” 


The unknown voice shocked all that were in the room, wands quickly drawn as they searched to identify the location of the threat. Quirinus moaned softly in his chair, terror spilling from his eyes as he conveyed a single message through his gaze to his fellow professors: 

Run

. 

“No.” Severus whispered, a possibility suddenly occurring to him. When his three snakes had overheard Quirrell getting threatened in an empty classroom, before Harry had collapsed, unconscious, with a burning fever— the mysterious voice had somehow 

left 

the room, although his boys only saw the defence professor leaving. Severus had searched the room himself, muttering spells to expose those using invisibility charms or other disguises, and his search had been fruitless. The windows of the room were all locked, from the inside, which meant the door had been the only exit. That would leave only one possibility: That the mysterious voice had left 

with 

Quirrell, perhaps… on the back of his head. 

Gasps echoed around the room as Quirrell’s turban fell, unravelled, to the stone-cold floor of the dungeons. A menacing laugh rose to the air, and Severus’s office felt twenty times colder than it normally was, sending chills through his backbone. 

His Dark Mark tingled. 

“It seems our little 

game 

is over, Quirinus.” 

All four wixen were old enough to have taken part in the war— old enough to know what the Dark Lord’s voice sounded like— old enough to know that the 

very same voice 

was coming from the back of Quirrell’s head. Horror crept beneath their skins as reality smashed into them: the Dark Lord, acting as a parasite on their defence professor, had been roaming freely around Hogwarts halls for the minimum of a year. The Dark Lord had been left, unsupervised, in classrooms with 

children

, muggleborn children, half-blooded children, and children from families who had scorned the Dark Lord. Not to mention the boy-who-lived 

himself

.

“I must say,” drawled the Dark Lord, “I missed these very halls— it reminds me of my days, venturing around the castle on my prefect rounds— yes, yes, I missed this place. Dumbledore’s fortress, they say— and yet, 

I’m here

.”  

No one dared to speak. 

And no one dared to mention that it was 

bloody awkward

, for the Dark Lord was still facing away from them, talking to the wall of Severus’s office. 

As if things couldn’t get worse, however: 

“Professor Snape!” 

“Mr. Potter!” Severus hissed. As if terror wasn’t already freezing his blood vessels shut, the green-eyed boy single-handedly stopped all flow of blood to and from the man’s heart. Never mind that Harry had been in and out of Quirrell’s classroom for the past year— the Dark Lord was now sitting in his exposed glory (albeit no one could really see this glory, as he was still facing the wall), and the one soul that the terrorist wanted dead had just walked into the room. “

What 

did I say about 

staying inside the classroom

?” 

“U-Um, to only come out when there’s an emergency,” Harry stuttered, his eyes flickering around the office in confusion. “But Draco burned his hand, and—” 

“Ah, Mr. 

Potter…

” The Dark Lord was practically grinning in glee, “We meet again at last.” 

Severus was absolutely 

not 

prepared when Harry looked up at him, confusion painted on his features, searching for answers in his professor’s eyes. Squeezing his eyes shut, the potions master prayed for Merlin to give him strength— and patience— and hopefully a pay raise. 

“Your parents 

died 

for you, Harry.” The Dark Lord continued, “They laid down their lives for 

yours

— your insignificant, meaningless, little 

life

.” 

“Umm,” Harry blinked, stunned to pieces at how direct the mysterious voice was, “Well, yeah, I’ve been told.” 

Whatever the Dark Lord had been expecting, it wasn’t 

that

. “You— You’ve been told?” 

“Yeah,” Harry shrugged, still glancing around the office, trying to figure out where the voice was coming from. Subconsciously, Severus had pulled the boy closer to him, wrapping him in the fabric of his long, black cloaks, which had protective charms embedded into them. Harry Potter would leave the office untouched, or Severus was going to fucking 

flip

. Then he would probably curse Quirrell into oblivion. “My aunt would tell me all the time. That my parents died in a car crash, drunk and everything, cause they didn’t want me.” 

Minerva sucked in a harsh breath, and Fillius looked like he’d just been smacked with a levitated desk. 

“They did want you.” Severus whispered quietly, because he knew Lily loved Harry, loved him to the ends of the world, loved him enough to lay down her life for his without even 

thinking

. Lily Evans loved her son fiercely, so fiercely that she would defy the Dark Lord, even when the terrorist offered to spare her. And James— James adored his son, his little lookalike, and with that love and adoration, took on the Dark Lord wandless, only to give his wife and child a few spare moments to run. 

“I know.” Harry smiled up at his professor, and for a moment, Severus felt like everything would be alright: Harry Potter grew up thinking his parents were alcoholics with an unwanted pregnancy, but Harry Potter would 

live 

knowing his parents loved him with everything they had, that his parents were among the bravest wixen known, that his parents fought with everything they had to protect their child. 

Everything would be alright. 

“My parents died fighting a wizarding terrorist,” Harry declared, glowering fiercely. “They died ending a war. My parents are pretty dang awesome, that’s what they are.” 

No one had to see the Dark Lord’s face (he was still facing the wall) to see how Harry’s little speech had taken him completely off-guard. However powerful or strategic the dark wizard might have been, Severus mused, nothing could prepare him for the unpredictability of eleven-year-olds. 

“You’re not… insignificant, Harry.” 

Quirrell looked mournful as he stared into the first-year’s eyes, a thousand regrets reflected in his gaze. Not trusting the man, Seveurs kept a protective hand on his young snake’s shoulder, bristling angrily at his colleague. 

“You are… kind, a-and compassionate,” Quirrell said softly, wincing as Voldermort’s anger flared through where they were connected. “H-Hardworking, t-too… y-you have more of an impact t-than you realise, Mr. P-Potter—” 

“You insolent fool!” The Dark Lord growled furiously. “Silence!” 

“T-The chocolates y-you gave to me, Mr. P-Potter,” Quirrell continued, persevering through the pain, “D-During C-C-Christmas… I shall never forget them. T-They were v-very… delicious.” 

“I’m glad you liked them,” Harry’s gaze softened into one of concern as Quirrell whimpered in pain. The Dark Lord did not like being defied. “C-Can we help him, Professor Snape? W-What’s the matter with him?” 

“I am no small matter, 

Potter

.” sneered the Dark Lord, menacing as ever. Severus tugged Harry closer, his right hand gripping his wand, commanding every protection spell he knew to ward the small boy against any tricks the dark wizard may have up his— er, Quirrell’s sleeve. “I am the greatest dark wizard of all time— I am—” 

“That’s the Dark Lord?” whispered Harry in disbelief, his hands wrapped around the fabric of Severus’s cloak. 

“Yeah.” Severus shrugged. He really should feel more on-guard and terrified, really, seeing that the Wizarding terrorist had manifested as a parasite on a Hogwarts staff, but Harry’s general disbelief of the matter was really downplaying how terror-inducing Voldermort was— plus, the facial disfigurement was 

still 

facing the opposite side of the office, where no one could see it, so… out of sight, out of mind. 

“Is he just a… bodiless voice?” Harry scrunched his eyebrows, glancing around the office, as if he expected the Dark Lord to have a ghostly, mist-like form. If the Dark Lord came into being as some blob, hovering in the air, he would be about a hundred percent less intimidating. 

“No, he’s attached to the back of Quirrell’s head.” The Head of Slytherin told him off-handedly. 

“Ohh.” Harry nodded understandingly. “Like a parasite?”

“Yes, like a parasite.” Fillius piped up with a wide grin. It seemed that the rest of the professors had caught on: talking about the Dark Lord casually made him a lot less terrorist-like, and it significantly decreased his fear factor. “

Excellent 

comparison, Mr. Potter. 10 points to Slytherin!” 

“So he’s just…” Harry blinked. “A little bug latched onto the back of Professor Quirrell’s head?” 

Poppy couldn’t contain her laughter and laughed aloud at this— the Dark Lord, most feared wizard of their time— characterised as a puny 

bug 

by the boy who had vanquished him at 15 months old. 

On the back of Quirrell’s head, the Dark Lord made a noise similar to a kettle going off. “I— am— the Dark Lord!” He insinuated angrily, emphasising on the words. “I am to be feared!” 

“He has a pair of very large lungs for a small parasite.” Harry whispered to Severus, making the older man crack a smile. 

“Indeed he does.” The potions master nodded, amused. His office had regained its normal temperature now, and the Dark Lord attached to Quirrell was as intimidating as— quoting Harry— a small parasite. 

No one could hold back their smiles now— even Minerva was hiding hers behind her sleeve, and Quirrell, however worn he looked, was cracking a grin at the corner of his mouth, too. The Dark Lord was nothing but rumpled skin, and he was as threatening as— well, rumpled skin. Without hands of his own, the darkest wizard of all time was just an angry voice that no one could see. 

“Silence!” roared the Dark Lord, sending tremors of sharp, excruciating pain through to Quirrell, who screamed in agony. 

“Can we help him, please, Professor Snape?” 

Begrudgingly, Severus glanced at the other professors, who nodded their heads in agreement. True, Quirrell had been secretly housing a prejudiced, evil wizard in a castle, but he was still a colleague of theirs, and from the mournful expression on his face— he regretted it. With a resigned sigh, the potions master agreed. 

“We can try.” Severus spoke. He didn’t have much experience with wizard-terrorists-turned-parasites, but between the four professors, they would come up with 

something

. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Unexpected as it may be, there was a lot of common ground between Harry and Professor Quirrell’s interests. While the rest of the professors racked their brains for a magical, terrorist-ridding pesticide, Harry sat, squatted, on the floor, before Quirrell, who was rather happily telling him about all the research he had done in his earlier years. Voldermort had been kindly shot with a silencing spell as Minerva curled her lip in clear disgust, muttering under her breath about how she didn’t possibly think he could get more hideous than he was before. 

As a Ravenclaw student, Quirrell had a penchant for learning, and in his student years, was known to have a gift for the theory of defensive spells— a topic he was more than happy to ramble about, and a topic Harry was more than happy to listen about. The boy soaked up the knowledge like a sponge, nodding attentively, asking questions every once a while. Never before in his teaching career had the defence professor been so in his element. 

“Defensive magic, as a general, is a giant umbrella of many, 

many 

spells and charms— more than you can imagine, Mr. Potter.” Quirrell was saying animatedly, although his hands were still bound to the chair. “Certain spells, of course, can fall under 

both 

offensive and defensive magic, as their intention may only be restrained by the creativity of the caster.” 

“Unbelievable.” Severus muttered, “Nearly the end of the year and 

now 

he starts acting like a 

proper 

teacher.” 

“Now, now, Severus, no need to be jealous.” Poppy cooed. 

The potions master reeled back, looking aghast. “I’m 

not 

jealous.” 

“Sure, Severus.” Minerva snorted. “Fillius— hypothetically— would a complex extraction charm, coupled with a warped containment charm— would that hold him? Would it work?” 

The short professor scrunched his eyebrows together, pursing his lips. There was something in his eyes— a gleam of curiosity, despite the dire situation. The man was a Ravenclaw at heart, and the face of a challenge only fed the fire for knowledge within him. 

“It is an interesting preposition, Minerva…” Fillius tapped his chin thoughtfully. “Quirinus, what do you think?” 

“You can’t possibly— Fillius—” Severus made a wrangled noise in his throat. 

“W-What? Me?” Quirrell looked shocked at his sudden involvement in the discussion. “W-Well, possibly, yes. It largely depends on how the two spells interact with each other, of course, but if they were both casted by warm-toned wands— perhaps dragon heartstring— and another contrasting core— the chances of the spells interacting correctly would be higher.” 

Severus, however reluctant at taking the man’s opinion to heart, considered it. “Would a kirin tail core work?” 

“I don’t see why not.” The defence professor shrugged. “Of course, there is a possibility that this may backfire, creating a magical black hole, so to speak, and suck the remaining life force out of me, but I honestly do not see what I have to lose.” 

Sympathy melted in Harry’s green, lake-like eyes. “It’s going to be okay.” he said softly, reaching a hand out to pat Quirrel’s knee in reassurance. As reassuring as he hoped to be, Quirrell didn’t react with thanks but with a violent 

scream 

that ricocheted around the room. 

With a terrified yelp, Harry leapt away from the man, tears springing to his eyes as the professor’s skin dried up rapidly, burning away under an invisible fire that consumed his body like a monster gobbling away. Severus pulled the young snake to him, instinctively, wand raised against his colleague, questioning if it was a trap. 

“I didn’t— I didn’t mean to, I don’t know what I did—” Harry sobbed, burying his face into the potion master’s robes, his own hand— the one that had touched Quirrell— burning red, blood vessels flushed against his skin. 

Poppy had already leapt into action, numerous spells and charms flying off the tip of her wand, blue tendrils wrapping around Quirrell, coaxing the fire away from him as his skin turned from pale to red to 

burnt

. She gritted her teeth, desperate for some cure against the flames that had burst across her colleague, devouring him at record speed. 

As skilled as the Hogwarts’ healer was, there was only so much magic could do. The professors stood in silence, Quirrell’s crumpled, coal-like body laying in a fossilised, foetus-like position. Voldermort had received the brunt of the damage— and no help from Poppy, obviously— and while he could still be out in the wild, the part of him that had been attached to Quirrell was now smothered into smithereens. 

“I— I didn’t mean to—” Harry whimpered, still crying, not daring to look at what he’d done. 

“You didn’t do anything.” Severus interjected firmly, kneeling and forcing the young Slytherin to look at him. “Do you understand, Harry?” 

Slowly, the boy nodded, tears prickling his eyelids once more as Quirrell’s body came into his view. “Can— Can we do something?” he asked, sniffling, wiping away his tears. “Oh— Oh— W-What about the stone, c-can we, maybe—” 

“The stone.” Minerva gasped. 

“Of course,” Filius murmured, glancing at Poppy, who nodded, signifying it was worth a try. “I shall return with it immediately.” 

The charms professor wasted no time fetching the Philosopher’s Stone, a glistening, multi-faceted ruby that shone like it was emitting light. Unable to resist his curiosity, Harry peaked from the safety of Severus’s robes, watching hopefully as the mediwitch gently shaved off a smidge of fine crystal from the surface of the stone into a goblet, which Minerva quickly filled with wine— wine conjured from Severus’s quarters (which he was not too happy about, but didn’t complain). With her wand, Poppy diluted the powder of the Philosopher’s Stone in wine, and held it up to Quirrell’s lips. 

Nothing happened for a moment, and as Poppy sighed, ready to admit defeat— the coal-like skin cracked away, revealing red, sore skin beneath. Piece by piece, Quirrell’s body was rejuvenated. And while his body was still scarred with patches of angry red, it was infinitely better than the burnt, unrecognisable state he had been in minutes ago. 

“I shall call St. Mungo’s and inform them that we are on our way,” Minerva said curtly as Poppy got right back into work, running diagnostic spells on Quirrell, fixing whatever she could fix, to keep him steady until he could get proper help. “Perhaps you should bring Mr. Potter back to the commons, Severus, and see to Mr. Malfoy’s burn.” 

“Of course.” Severus was reluctant to leave, of course, seeing as they were in 

his 

office, having just witnessed the temporary death of his former— or current— master, the Dark Lord— but Minerva knew best when it came to kids, and he was no fool, either. The adults were armed by years of war and experience, and still they were shaken up. At this rate, he would have to put Harry through therapy until the boy was thirty. “Come, Harry.” 

“He’ll be okay?” asked Harry softly, his eyes lingering on the professor. 

“He will get the best help there is.” answered Severus— not a definite answer, and from the reluctance in Harry’s steps, he knew it too. Regardless, the boy accepted it without another word.

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

The matter with Quirrell and the (brief) resurface of the Dark Lord passed unknowingly to the entire school— most of which were still wrapped up in their exams. Severus (unhappily) took the position of the defence professor until the end of term, as Quirrell had, unfortunately, taken an early leave due to a family emergency. 

It went without saying, of course, that Hermione, Draco, Theodore, Ron, and Neville were all filled in on the incident. Severus had collected the first years together after leaving his office, then rounded them all to the infirmary— to get Harry checked, and to get Draco’s burn tended to. They all had varying reactions— Hermione, Ron, and Neville were mainly horrified and worried for Harry, while Draco was feeling conflicted, having heard bits and pieces of the Dark Lord from his father, and Theodore— Theodore was oddly quiet, contemplative, even. 

In between invigilating, marking examination papers for not one but 

two 

classes (Minerva and Filius offered to help spread some of the workload, thank Merlin), and constantly keeping an eye out for the first-years, Severus had his hands as full as they could get. They had a bit of… explaining to do for Dumbledore, as his defence professor was just upped and sent to St. Mungo’s, burnt to a crisp with no forewarning whatsoever. While the headmaster wasn’t exactly pleased (he had a disgruntled twinkle in his eyes— Severus was getting oddly good at interpreting twinkles), there wasn’t much he could do. 

Just with that, another school year was concluded— thank Merlin, because Severus didn’t know how much more he could put up with. Glancing away from his last potions essay— another 

atrocious 

piece of garbage he couldn’t believe he had to lay his eyes on—he realised it was time for him to put away his work and— believe it or not, have his 

fourth 

heart-to-heart session with Harry-bloody-Potter. 

Yep. 

He was having therapy sessions with the son of his sworn nemesis. Given that the boy had defeated a terrorist at 15 months old, grew up in an abusive family believeing his parents were alcoholics, and almost accidentally killed the host of said terrorist that he had defeated, there was a 

shit ton 

to unload. 

“Professor?” 

Taking a deep breath to compose himself, Severus neatly gathered the rest of his essays— he had half a mind to burn them all with a simple 

ignem

— and cleared his throat. “Come in.” 

Harry let himself in, closing the door behind him and scurrying onto the seat he had occupied for four nights in a row now— a soft couch that Severus had transfigured from one of his office chairs. “Good evening, Professor.” 

“Good evening, Harry.” Severus nodded in response, wishing he hadn’t put away his papers, so he’d have something to do with his hands. It was always awkward starting their sessions, and thus far, they’d always started with greeting each other, until the potions master found an opening into an issue that they had to unpack. “How are you feeling today?” 

“Good.” Harry responded, his emerald eyes flicking to meet his professor’s. An improvement, Severus noted to himself— the past few sessions, Harry would let his gaze wander around the office in favour of 

not 

meeting the potion master’s gaze. “Are you nearly done with marking the papers, professor?” 

“Yes,” Severus cracked a slight smile, “I’m nearly done with all the atrocious nonsense your seniors are writing into their exams.” 

Harry allowed himself a laugh, although his shoulders were still tense. “What… are we talking about today?” he asked carefully. In their previous sessions, Severus had been careful not to push the boy too far— Slytherins liked a subtle approach, after all. A quick search in the library had given him a couple manuals on handling children— with trauma. Severus didn’t have any of the natural warmth that Poppy had, or the experience that Minerva did, but if he could do one thing, he could research. 

“What would you like to talk about?” Severus leaned back into his chair, lacing his fingers together. Their first session was spent tackling the most pressing matter— Harry’s guilt at nearly killing Quirrell— not his fault, although Severus was still pursuing the scientific— or magical— reason behind the reaction. 

In their second session, Severus attempted to press into the boy’s nightmares— which didn’t turn out well, as he’d clammed up after a few questions hit closer to home. That night, Harry had been mostly unresponsive to the follow-ups, responding strictly with nodding, short ‘yeses’ and ‘nos’. Eventually, knowing that he wasn’t getting anywhere that night, Severus dismissed the first-year— although he did tail the boy back to the commons, just to make sure he got back safe.

Determined to fix his mistakes, Severus took a gentler approach on their third session, staying off the topic and giving Harry a potion manual to read as he marked his papers. They had casual conversation here and there— mostly Severus commenting on the upper years’ papers— and towards the end, Harry reluctantly opened up about some of the things he’d seen in his dreams— of his own accord, which the Slytherin professor was massively proud of. It wasn’t going to be easy, but there was progress. 

“Dunno.” Harry shrugged, averting his gaze again. 

“Don’t do that,” reprimanded the professor, giving the boy a pointed look. “No shrugging, Mr. Potter. Slytherins do not 

shrug

. It’s improper. Do you understand?” 

“Sorry, professor.” mumbled Harry. 

Resisting the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose, Severus corrected the boy once more. “No mumbling either, Mr. Potter. You wish to become a healer, correct? You must carry yourself with confidence. Of course, your confidence must be backed with knowledge— which I believe you have no trouble acquiring— so, no mumbling, and no shrugging, Mr. Potter.” 

Harry straightened up, which Severus took as a plus. Pomona had told him about the young snake’s interest in medicine— which he was more than happy to encourage. Knowledge, like he’d said, wasn’t going to be a problem. From what he had seen, as long as Harry was interested in it, he would give his all to study it. If he kept up that attitude for the next seven years— which Severus would assure that he 

did

— he would be on a direct path to becoming a healer. 

“Let’s make a deal, okay?” Severus proposed, “Madam Pince has told me you’ve exhausted the medicinal books in the library. I happen to have dabbled in healing when I was completing my masters, and have a few advanced texts on them. For every question you answer, I’ll give you one. If you want— I’ll even ask Madam Pomfrey for some from her personal collection.” 

There was no missing the way Harry perked at this. Dumbledore would’ve been jealous of that star-bright twinkle in his eyes. 

“Do we have a deal?” 

“Sure.” Harry answered— then retracted back hesitatingly. “... Can I choose not to answer some questions?” 

“Of course.” Severus agreed, “As long as you answer a question— any question— you get a book. If you don’t want to answer one, we can skip it, and you can answer something else. No penalty for skipping questions.” 

“Okay.” Harry nodded. 

“First question, then,” Severus began, catching the way the boy shrunk into himself at the words. “You’ve just about finished your first year— which subject do you like the most?” 

Caught off-guard at the general topic of the question, Harry frowned, contemplating. “... Will you get mad if it isn’t potions?” 

“No.” Severus couldn’t help but roll his eyes good-naturedly. “I will not.” 

Pursing his lips, Harry considered his options. “Can I choose more than one subject?” 

“I suppose.” 

“Potions and Herbology, then.” Harry answered happily. 

Nodding in acknowledgement, Severus raised his wand, Crockett’s “Beginner’s Guide to Healing”— a textbook commonly used for undergraduate students in healing— flying down from the shelves to settle on the desk before Harry. “That’s one question. Shall we move on?” 

“Yes please,” said Harry, nodding eagerly. 

“Next question: you’ve brewed the fifteen potions covered in the first-year syllabus, and on top of that, you’ve done a couple upper year brews, as well. Which one do you like brewing the most— and why?” 

“That’s a tough one,” whined the first-year, “I like all of them!” 

Severus raised an eyebrow. “Even the Herbicide Potion?” 

The Herbicide Potion was a foul-smelling, disgusting-looking potion that bubbled ominously while it boiled for a half hour. The potions classroom reeked during the week they studied the brew, and Draco’s complaints about his robes smelling could be heard from all corners of the castle. Severus almost agreed with Ronald Weasley when the redhead threw a comment across the great hall that week— 

“We know you stink, Malfoy, for the love of Merlin, please shut up!”

 

“Okay, maybe not 

all 

of them.” Corrected the boy sheepishly. “Well, of everything we learned, the Wiggenweld is probably the most useful— and it doesn’t smell half bad, but… I think I enjoyed brewing Norberta’s sleeping potion the most.” 

He glanced at the professor experimentally, and while the man looked exasperated, he didn’t look as if he was going to scold the boy, instead gesturing for him to go on with a slight tilt of his head. 

“I think— um, since we had to put a lot of research and calculation into it— it was the most… fulfilling.” Harry explained carefully, “I guess… of everything else we brewed, I was happy when it came out good, but Norberta’s potion— we kind of did everything by ourselves, and we didn’t know if it would work, so when it 

did

— it was the best feeling 

ever

.” 

Severus grumbled under his breath. “Of course. Of everything you could choose from, you picked the one that put your life in the most danger, and the one you brewed without supervision. What did I expect.” 

With another displeased grumble, Severus raised his wand, and another book descended from the shelves— this one by Yelloworth, one of the first renowned healers in Magical Britain. 

“Next question,” Severus cleared his throat. It was now 

his 

turn to watch the boy carefully, knowing the way he phrased his next question could make or break how the session turned out. “The semester’s nearly over— how do you feel about going back to your aunt and uncle’s?” 

While they hadn’t addressed it 

directly

 yet, Severus knew without a doubt that Harry did 

not 

look forward to returning home, and judging by the way the boy froze, he was right. 

“I— I, um,” Harry mumbled, his gaze flicked onto his fidgeting fingers, “It’ll be nice, I guess. Um, s-some of the potions and charms I’ve learnt c-could really help Aunt Petunia with her chores.” 

“And she would appreciate that, I’m sure?” 

The boy went silent. “I… maybe.” his voice quietened, going almost inaudible. 

“You haven’t gone home for the whole year,” Severus said, trying to sound gentle— something he was not accustomed to— “Are you looking forward to seeing your relatives?” 

He was squirming now. “It’ll be nice,” he repeated, “Er— going back— where— um, I’m familiar with.” 

“I see,” Even though it was clear as day that Harry wasn’t exactly being truthful about how 

he 

felt about the matter, Severus didn’t press on, and levitated four more books from the shelves to settle onto the pile on the desk. “Anything else you’d like to add?” 

There were a million unsaid things Harry was keeping back, Severus knew. But if it didn’t come from the boy willingly, he wasn’t going to try and force it out of the child— the second session had proven just how effective that had been. He was already coaxing the boy with the promise of books and resources— all he had to be now was 

patient

, and hope that over time the boy could learn to trust him enough to let Severus help. 

“No, I don’t think so.” mumbled Harry. 

“Alright.” Glancing at the clock, Severus hummed. “It’s getting late. You should get back to your dorm, Mr. Potter. You may keep these books with you— and return them to me when you return for your second year.” 

“Thank you.” said the first-year, tugging the heavy stack of thick books towards the edge of the table, so he could pick it up— the stack had to be at least a third of his weight, and from all the soft huffs he was making, there was no way Harry would make it back to the commons.

Dryly, Severus spoke: “Has Professor Filtwick not taught you the levitation charm, Mr. Potter?” 

“Oh,” Harry flushed, as if suddenly remembering he was a wizard. “Right.” 

Rather embarrassed, Harry uttered the incantation under his breath, floating his books before him, trudging all the way to the office door as Severus watched. Just before he shut the door behind him, the boy turned back, hesitant— 

“C-Could I— maybe, um,” he said softly, his gaze shying away. 

“Remember what we said about mumbling, Mr. Potter?” Severus raised an eyebrow, rising from his desk. When Harry didn’t speak, he approached the boy, who opened his mouth and closed it again, hesitating and hesitating. “Mr. Potter, a verbal answer, if you could.” 

“Yes, professor.” Harry said, more clearly now. “Would— Would it be possible for me to— maybe— stay at the castle… over the holidays? I’ll be good, I promise, won’t get into any trouble, I promise—” 

“I’m afraid there’s no staff at Hogwarts over the summer, so no.” 

Drooping like a withered flower, Harry hung his head, accepting the answer dejectedly. “Oh. Okay. Good night then, professor.” 

“

However

,” Severus cleared his throat, speaking impulsively now. “I will be writing a letter to your aunt. You must remain with her for the first few days of summer— 

but 

you will be spending the rest of your summer with me. Your potions grade is mediocre and you require extra one-on-one tutoring to keep up with your peers for the next year. Do you understand?” 

For a moment, Harry 

did not 

understand. His potions grade was just fine— until it hit him, and then 

oh

, it hit him. 

There was a flurry of falling books— which Severus caught with a levitation charm of his own, and just as he opened his mouth to berate the boy about damaging 

his 

textbooks, the first-year latched himself onto Severus’s leg with a tight hug, his face burrowed in the potion master’s robes. Rendered wordless, the professor stood, stunned, unsure of an appropriate reaction. Before he came up with the appropriate one, however, Harry unlatched himself, bringing his sleeves up to (embarrassingly) wipe tears from under his glasses. 

“Thank you, professor.” he mumbled happily, sheepishly picking up the textbooks with his wand. “Um, good night, Professor Snape.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

“Remember to write, Harry,” Hermione insisted as they neared Kings’ Cross Station. She’d gone green with jealousy when she saw the stack of medicinal textbooks Harry was packing into his luggage— he’d left one out for the train ride. “And tell me 

all 

about everything you read.” 

“I will, ‘Mione, relax.” laughed Harry, feeling so, so full of happiness. He was surrounded by the greatest ragtag group of friends he could ask for, and he would be spending most of the summer with Professor Snape— who never did say what day he was coming to pick him up, but Harry was hopeful, and he 

knew 

that the potions master would keep his word. Harry would just have to be good for Aunt Petunia, for just a couple of days— and then the rest of the holidays with his professor! 

“I’ll write, too.” Theodore said, “And ‘Mione, I’ll send you some books from the Nott library. It’s my mother’s collection— shelves and shelves of Norse magic. Try not to attempt any of the spells or charms that have a skull on the top of the page though, you might blow up your neighbourhood.” 

“I’m going strictly theoretical during the summers, Theo,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Remember what Professor Snape said? We aren’t allowed to perform underage magic— the Ministry will track us down if we do—” 

“The Ministry’s rules don’t apply to the Nott Manor, and they certainly don’t apply to the warding charms my mother’s set up around the place.” Theodore grinned. “The Ministry would’ve been on to us a long, 

long 

time ago if they knew what kind of Norse magics we were testing there. I’ve got to continue my mother’s work— so it’s a summer-long research session for me.” 

Hermione pouted. “That’s so unfair. The only thing I can do is potions— and even then I have to stick to the basic ones.” 

“But you’ll get to be with your parents.” Harry reminded her. 

“Oh, I think I see mine!” Draco grinned, catching a flash of light blonde as the train rolled into the station. “Oh, look, a whole bunch of redheads— must be yours, Weasley.” 

“Shut up, Malfoy.” Ron shot back, catching sight of his younger sister, Ginny, waving excitedly at the incoming train. “Blimey, Ginny’s grown so much in a year! Hard to believe it’s really been a whole year, huh?” 

“Oh, oh, I think I see gran, too!” Neville piped up, patting his pocket to make sure Trevor was still safe. In his hands, he held the Sleeper's Trumpet that Professor Sprout had gifted him— one of his most treasured plants. “Harry, Hermione, you’ve got to come meet my gran— she’ll love you both.” 

“I’d love to,” Harry said, unlatching Hedwig’s cage and rousing the snowy. “Off you go, Hedwig— meet us at Privet Drive, and stay out of Uncle Vernon’s way, you got it?” 

The owl hooted sleepily, but untucked her face from under her wing and hopped onto Harry’s arm, where he lifted her to the open window, allowing her to extend her wings and take flight into the open skies. Should she remain in her cage, she’d be locked in for the next few days— which Harry couldn’t bear to do to her, seeing as she had grown accustomed to freedom at Hogwarts. 

“

Wingardium leviosa

,” Ron chanted, sending a smug look Hermione’s way when he did it successfully, levitating both their trunks out from the storage compartment. “How’s that, Granger?” 

“Oh shush, Ronald.” she rolled her eyes. “Hey, are you guys coming? Neville— Neville— no, Neville, just hold on to your plant— I’ll get your trunk for you— Merlin help us if you drop the Sleeper's Trumpet on the ground—” 

“That’d be fun,” Theodore snorted. “The entire train’ll be asleep in two minutes. Draco, if you’re done adjusting your hair, could you move over? Harry and I are trying to get our things, you know.” 

“Patience is a virtue, Nott, and a virtue you do not have.” Draco huffed. 

Theodore hummed. “What I 

do 

have, Malfoy, is your wand, and an extensive knowledge of Norse hexes that your parents don’t know counterspell to.” 

“Draco, your hair looks 

perfect

, and I’m sure your parents won’t love you any less if you show up with a hair out of place.” Harry assured, levitating his and Theodore’s trunks down now that Draco had moved out of the way. “Shall we? Hermione, Ron, and Neville are already down on the platform.” 

While she initially had qualms about her grandson’s Slytherin friends, Augusta Longbottom begrudgingly acknowledged that they weren’t so bad. Neville was a 180 change from when she first saw him off onto the Hogwarts Express— he stood with more confidence than before, and there was a glow in his eyes that wasn’t there before— and if a ragtag group of Slytherins and one other Gryffindor was responsible for this change— well, as long as it was for the better, she had no complaints. 

“I’ll be right back— I think I see my parents waiting over there.” Hermione had said, shooting off through the crowd to collect her confused (and amazed) Muggle parents. 

“Augusta!” Molly Weasley greeted the older woman as the Weasley clan approached them— Ron had brought them over in favour of introducing his parents to his friends. Like Augusta, Molly and Arthur had been worried about Ron mixing with the Slytherins— but one letter from Percy talking about how sweet little Harry was had been enough to placate them. 

Thankfully, Draco had enough sense to leave the group and to 

not 

bring his parents over— there would be a live rendition of the Weasley-Malfoy feud on the platform, on a 

big 

scale. At least Ron and Draco could get along now— somewhat— their fathers, however, were a different story, and hell would freeze over before Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy could agree on something. 

“Hello, Mrs. Weasley,” greeted Harry, “Thanks for the sweater.” 

“Oh, no need for thanks, dear.” said Molly kindly. “Did you have a good year?” 

Harry smiled, thinking of all the people he’d met— all the things they’d learned— all the trouble they’d gotten into. The troll— breaking into Snape’s office— smuggling Norberta— Quidditch— “Yeah. It’s been a great year.” 

“That’s nice to hear.” Molly smiled. 

“I think I see my aunt and uncle,” Harry said suddenly, spotting a disgruntled-looking family standing by a pillar. From the looks of it, Dudley was whining about something, and Aunt Petunia was coaxing him with the promise of extra bacon for dinner. “I guess this is it.” 

“Write lots!” Hermione had her hands cupped around her mouth, yelling so he could hear her over the commotion of the station. “Until September, Harry!” 

Harry smiled. 

“Until September.”

Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Harry wasn’t exactly expecting his relatives to greet with open arms and wide smiles, but he didn’t think they’d be 

that 

harsh, either. Unable to do magic, he struggled and struggled, pushing his cart down the bumpy road to where the Dursleys’ were parked— in the furthest corner of the lot. Thankfully, once they reached the car, Uncle Vernon was nice enough to help him toss his trunks into the back of the car— although he looked absolutely repulsed at the thought of touching Harry’s belongings, wiping his hands on his slacks after. 

With a bit of persuasion from Aunt Petunia— (“He’s not going to give you a pig’s tail, Dudley, he can forget about stepping foot into our house if he even 

dares 

raise his hand against you—”), Dudley reluctantly got onto the car, although he sat pressed against the window, as far as he could get from Harry without actually being outside the car. 

At Privet Drive, Harry’s robes, books— yes, even the ones he’d borrowed from Professor Snape— and wand were all tossed into his trunks, which were in turn, tossed into the cupboard under the stairs and locked with a key that Uncle Vernon wore around his neck with a wicked grin. 

On his third evening back, however, something peculiar happened. Harry had been minding his business, mopping the kitchen after his relatives had retired upstairs— when Aunt Petunia strolled into the kitchen, gesturing to him wordlessly with a snap of her fingers. It had been most astonishing when she opened his previously-locked cupboard, clicking her tongue at him, telling him to be quick. 

He blinked in surprise, but didn’t wait for her to speak before diving into his trunk, fumbling for his wand— Professor Snape’s textbooks— and a few vials of potion-based fertilisers he’d brewed to bring home for Aunt Petunia’s garden. The roses on the front lawn had lost their vibrant colour during the time he had been gone, and while he was leaving in a few days, he wanted to restore them to their previous glory before he left for Professor Snape’s. Yes, it was Aunt Petunia’s garden— but it was as much his, for how long he’d been caring for it. 

“It’s for the garden,” he’d explained quietly when she gave him a suspicious glare. “Er, I had spare time before our semester ended, so I brewed some fertilisers to use on the roses.” 

Turning her nose at him, she harrumphed. “Don’t you dare kill them,” she warned, sniffling angrily, “Mrs. Holden across the road complimented my roses today— and yesterday, Mrs. Turner. Whatever you’re doing in the garden— keep at it, or else you’ll be putting all of those back.” 

It was then it dawned on Harry. Aunt Petunia’s plants had withered under the absence of his attention— and now that he had returned, they were returning to their former glory, and the neighbours of Privet Drive had noticed. The roses were Aunt Petunia’s pride and joy— aside from Dudley— and having them brighten up in just a few days of summer must’ve soothed her wounded ego. Unexpectedly, she credited him for the revival of her beloved flowers, and hence, was rewarding him for his work by allowing him a few items from his trunk without Uncle Vernon’s knowing. 

“Thank you.” he bowed, grateful— he would pour his heart and soul into restoring the roses— he would’ve, anyway, as he couldn’t bear to see them in such a terrible state— but now he was going to give 200% to it. 

In the next few days, Aunt Petunia was… kinder to him. He suddenly found that she was sending him out often— to tend to the garden— but also to get away from Dudley and Uncle Vernon, limiting the time they had to snicker and laugh at him in the open. Most mornings, he would be allowed to slip out after cooking breakfast, avoiding their breakfast-time jeering. Life was good. As good as it could get, anyway. 

Then, the letter arrived. 

It was a Tuesday— Harry had been the one to pick up the mail, of course— and noticed that it was addressed to Aunt Petunia, despite it holding the Hogwarts’ wax stamp. 

“Here.” he said, much to Uncle Vernon’s surprise. Most mails were directed to him— which the pile of electricity and water bills on the dining table could testify to. It wasn’t often a letter came addressed to his 

wife

, which he would’ve started grumbling about— if Petunia hadn’t gone pale at recognition of Hogwarts’ symbol. 

With trembling hands, she unfolded the envelope— and drew out the letter. 

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry

Mrs. Dursley, I hope this letter finds you well. I have to inform you that due to the state of his Potion grades, I am requesting for Mr. Potter to attend extra tutoring over the summer, until the week the new school semester begins. Please have him pack his school belongings, as I shall pick him up tomorrow morning. 

Do not hesitate to write shall you have any inquiries. 

Regards, 


S.T. Snape


Head of Slytherin House

Potions Master

“Summer tutoring!” she repeated, looking shocked. At her words, Uncle Vernon grinned widely— he would be rid of Harry just a few days into the summer holidays! It was absolutely spectacular, and from the matching cackle on Dudley’s face, the son shared his father’s sentiments. “Due to the state of your 

Potion 

grades—” she spat at the subject name— “You insolent boy! Don’t tell me you— didn’t— study— properly!” 

In all honesty, Aunt Petunia was less concerned of his nephew’s grades, as compared to her concern for her garden. It didn’t take a genius to figure out that Harry’s thumb was greener than hers— and with everything he’d learned from Herbology, he had returned from school, thumb greener than ever. Perhaps almost as green as his eyes. 

Uncle Vernon, on the other hand, couldn’t get any more delighted. “Due to the state of your grades!” he cackled wickedly, “You ain’t any better there than you are here, are you?” 

As much as he wanted to defend his grades— third in the year, thank you very much— he’d lost to Hermione and Anthony Goldstein— Harry kept his mouth shut and sucked it up. Professor Snape would be coming to pick him up the next day! That was worth all the insults they could say in a lifetime. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

When Professor Snape said ‘tomorrow morning’, no one had really expected 

seven o’clock in the morning

, which was when the potions master, decked out in Muggle clothing— showed up on the doorstep. Harry had just been washing up the pots and pans as Uncle Vernon and Dudley trudged down the stairs for breakfast— when the doorbell rang. 

“Good morning, Mrs. Dursley.” said Professor Snape smoothly, not faltering when said woman paled into a deathly white. “I believe Mr. Potter has his belongings ready?” 

“H— He’s— you—” she stuttered, hand trembling. “You!”

“Oh, forgive me.” Severus interjected, sending a polite nod towards Uncle Vernon, who was glancing back and forth between his wife and the dark-looking man on their front door. “My name is Severus Snape. I’m Mr. Potter’s potions professor and his head of house.” 

“

You’re

 his professor?” Petunia hissed, jabbing a finger at him. To his credit, Severus only raised an eyebrow, not an ounce of offence rising to his features. 

“Yes, Mrs. Dursley.” said Severus, “Unfortunately, I neglected to bring the employment contract I’ve signed with Headmaster Dumbledore— you know him, I believe? 

However

, what I 

have 

brought is Mr. Potter’s report card, which, as I know, has yet to be delivered to his guardians.” 

Uncle Vernon laughed loudly at this, rubbing his hands together, like anticipating the climax of a football match. “Read it aloud, then! Boy— whatever you’re doing, come out here!” 

“Very well,” Severus nodded, acknowledging the emerging Harry with a nod, “Mr. Potter. Astronomy; exceeds expectations, sixth in overall year. Charms; outstanding, third in year. Defence Against Dark Arts; outstanding, 

first 

in year, tied with Mr. Goldstein, Herbology; outstanding, fourth in year. History of Magic; 

first 

in year, tied with Ms. Granger. Potions; 

first in year

, tied with Ms. Granger, Mr. Nott, Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Malfoy. And finally, Transfiguration, second in year.” 

Whatever the Dursleys’ had expected, it wasn’t 

that

. 

It was hard to tell who looked more pleased— Harry, for his amazing results— and Severus, for, well, the faces that the Dursleys’ were sporting. 

“As his head of house, I have to say that Mr. Potter did rather well in his first year, 

especially 

coming from a background where he never had any exposure to the course material prior to attending Hogwarts. As an overall, I am pleased to inform you that Mr. Potter has finished third in the year— an impressive placing.” Severus finished with a polite smile. 

“I— then— what in the bloody hell is the tutoring for?!” blundered Uncle Vernon angrily. 

“Ah,” Severus said, looking pleased that the topic had been brought up. “Mr. Potter, while young, has demonstrated a talent for Potions, and has, on top of that, expressed interest into experimental brewing, which I shall be doing a lot of this summer. In order to, ah, cultivate his enthusiasm for Potions, I am offering him an opportunity to learn 

additional 

material— that is not covered in the syllabus— as I believe his grades prove that he is more than deserving of this opportunity.” 

Harry was smiling so wide that his cheeks were starting to hurt. 

“He’s quite the well-rounded student.” Severus continued seriously, “In addition to staying on top of his academics, Mr. Potter is the star player of his house sports team— the fastest we’ve seen in a while.” 

“Not fair!” shrieked Dudley, who hadn’t made it onto Smelting’s football team— his father had wanted him to. “I want to be on a sports team too!” He proceeded to run upstairs in a tantrum, his heavy footfalls ringing in the hall after his departure. 

“I believe you are packed, Mr. Potter?” said Severus pleasantly. 

“Yes, professor.” said Harry, drawing his wand questioningly (Uncle Vernon was horrified to see him have it, and Aunt Petunia looked away). “May I?” 

Severus nodded, casting a non-verbal spell under his breath to jumble the Ministry’s tracking spell on underage wizards. It was illegal, of course, to do such a thing, but he was Severus Snape. It wouldn’t be the 

most 

illegal of all the illegal things he’d done. “Go ahead.” 

“

Alohomora

.” whispered Harry, unlocking his cupboard, “

Wingardium leviosa

.” 

“

Esse parva

.” said Severus, shrinking Harry’s trunks so that he could tuck them in his pocket. “Is that everything?” 

“Yes.” said Harry, although he turned back, as if suddenly remembering something. “Oh— Aunt Petunia. Um— I’ve left the fertilisers in the back of the shed. They’re labelled— you should sprinkle sparse amounts of the first one— the dark green one— every two days, the blue one— that’s the flower brightener— every morning, and the yellow one— that’s for repelling bugs and a fresher scent— every weekend. There should be enough for two months— I’ll mail some more back during the school year, okay?” 

“Don’t you dare send it by owl mail,” she hissed at him, crossing her arms stiffly. 

“What fertilisers?” howled Uncle Vernon. 

“Come, Mr. Potter.” interjected Severus timely, leading Harry outside the house. “Call for your owl.” 

Upon hearing Harry’s whistle, Hedwig descended from the skies— albeit grumpily, as it was early in the morning and no time for an owl to be up— but perched on his shoulders obediently. “Good girl,” he murmured, fingers reaching to comb through her ruffled feathers affectionately. 

“Meet us at Wrenbury Lane.” he instructed quietly to the bird, who tittered her understanding, giving Harry’s ear a playful nibble before she took off again. “Is this your first time side-apparating, Mr. Potter?” 

“Side-what?” 

“Side-apparating, Mr. Potter. Hold on tight and 

do not 

let go, no matter what, do you understand?” 

“Yes, sir.” Harry nodded, feeling nervous. 

As the green-eyed boy turned to look at Privet Drive one last time, just in time to meet his aunt’s gaze as her husband forcefully pushed the door close— 

the neighbours will come out soon

, he could imagine him saying. Before he could mouth goodbye, the colours of Number Four whirled together in a mess of hues, and then they were gone. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Had Professor Snape not been holding onto his arm, Harry would’ve crashed into the ground at what could only be a hundred miles per hour 

and 

probably crushed his ankle. Still jolted from the whirling feeling in his stomach— it was almost as if someone stuck a cake whisk into the contents of his stomach— he belched, trying not to feel sick. 

“The first time can be a bit rough,” commented Professor Snape dryly. “If you’re feeling better, we don’t have all day.” 

Queasiness fading from his mind, Harry stood up, taking a good look at their surroundings. They had landed in a bricky little town, houses pressed up to each other in odd ways, tall and lanky, in shades of muted grey and blue. Ravens and crows perched on the roofing, on the occasional lamppost, cawing into the greying skies, calling to their friends behind the murky clouds. 

Harry let Professor Snape lead him out onto the main road— a roundabout cobblestone road, framed by a grocery store, a barber’s, a bookstore. They passed winding roads, down and down, streets and streets of odd, lopsided houses, until they eventually derailed from the main path and down a little street— 

Wrensbury Lane

, Harry recognised from the street sign. 

“Number 715, Wrensbury Lane, Iveyworth.” said Severus, “Remember.” 

“Yes.” nodded Harry, who was astonished to see Hedwig, perched on the mailbox before Number 715— well, it 

used 

to be a mailbox, but someone— probably Professor Snape— had removed the metal box, leaving only a perch-like pole. “Hedwig!” 

She chirped in greeting, almost in an approving tone.  

“Come.” Severus, who was already at the door— dark blue, with faded silver framing the little peephole, the metal numbers nailed into the wood beneath. The houses on their street were all tall and lanky, quite like Professor Snape himself, Harry thought. Clicking for Hedwig to hop onto his arm, he followed the older man inside the house, unable to help but gawk at the interior. 

It was no fancy place, with unreachable ceilings, but it was high nonetheless. A single-bulbed, simplistic chandelier-like fixture hung above them in the entryway.  A couple greyscale pictures— all pictures viewing the front of different houses— were framed along the hallway, but Harry didn’t have long to stare, as Professor Snape was already deep in the house, impatiently calling him along. 

The hallway opened up on the right to a living room, complete with three giant panes of windows around the corner, right above a comfy-looking grey couch. The rest of the living room was adequately decorated with ceiling-reaching bookshelves, a coffee table, decorated with a terrarium and a stack of newspapers. Books were 

everywhere

— stacked neatly in the corners, stuffed in every crook available on the shelves, arranged on the windowsill. 

Beside the living room was a small kitchen, cupboards in faded, dark blue and silver-black handles. There was a stove, an electric kettle— which Harry was shocked to see— and a rack of neatly stored plates, pots and pans. Hanging on the wall was a collection of polished knives— not entirely surprising, Professor Snape 

was 

a potions master, afterall, and there probably wasn’t anything more precious to a potions master than their collection of various blades. 

“Mr. Potter,” said Professor Snape impatiently, already further down the corridor, standing before a pair of staircases— one leading up and one leading down. “If you could please be bothered—” 

“Sorry,” said Harry, hurrying up to where the man was standing. 

“That leads to the basement,” said Professor Snape, “Which is where my lab is. As I told your aunt, you 

will 

be doing research with me over the summer— you will 

not 

be allowed to slack off on your studies under my watch. However, you are 

not 

permitted to go down without my supervision, 

ever

. If I am working in my lab alone, you are not to disturb me unless there is an emergency. Do you understand?”

Instead of answering, Harry stared numbly at the older man— not having expected to 

actually 

do research with the potions master. Sure, Professor Snape had been allowing them to rework Norberta’s potion, but to actually allow Harry to work with someone of his calibre… 

“Mr. Potter, an answer, please.” 

“Oh. Um. Yes.” flushed Harry. 

Satisfied, the professor then led the way upstairs, leading into a short corridor with three doors. The walls were coloured with faded blue wallpaper— and when Harry looked closer, he could see a subtle, shimmering pattern of wild flowers all along the hallway.  

“This is my room.” said Professor Snape stiffly, “You are not permitted to go inside 

at all

. Am I clear?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Nodding, Professor Snape then led Harry to one of the two remaining rooms. Between the two, he showed Harry the one with the wider door, first. “This will be your room.” 

Harry’s jaw dropped to the ground. The room was furnished rather simply— it had a bed, with a thick green comforter; a cupboard with a built-in mirror; a desk, and shelves lining the walls. A set of bay windows adorned a corner of his room, and below it was a simple, built-in couch 

perfect 

for reading on a rainy day. All in all, it was better than anything he had ever had at Privet Drive. 

“The bathroom is the door beside yours,” said the professor, “Now, whenever you finish gawking, feel free to join me downstairs for breakfast.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Breakfast was the best thing Harry had ever seen. It was nothing as… varied as Hogwarts’, but the bowl of yoghurt, fresh strawberries and crackers still looked positively exquisite. Professor Snape was already halfway through his own bowl when Harry descended from his room, a copy of 

The Daily Prophet 

in his hands. In a small green bowl opposite the professor was Harry’s own serving. Unable to contain himself, the boy reached forward for it, watching warily for the older man’s reaction as he picked it up carefully, retreating towards a corner of the kitchen to eat quickly. 

“What do you think you’re doing, Mr. Potter?” said Professor Snape irritably, looking away from his newspaper. 

“Oh, I, er, um.” Harry stammered, unsure of what to do. Professor Snape was still staring at him expectantly, and Harry didn’t know if it meant he was supposed to eat in his room, somewhere out of sight, perhaps…? 

“Do you need an invitation to the table?” the professor raised an eyebrow when Harry still didn’t move, his body frozen still. 

Blinking, it dawned on Harry what he was supposed to do. Professor Snape had left his bowl in front of a seat— that had meant to be 

his 

seat. Feeling embarrassed now, he shuffled over, clambering onto the wooden chair opposite the older man, trying very 

very 

hard not to meet his gaze. 

“They didn’t allow me to eat at the table.” mumbled Harry, as a weak explanation. 

Rather angrily, Professor Snape cursed under his breath in a language Harry didn’t understand— and looked him in the eyes. “From now onwards, you 

will 

eat at the dining table for every single meal— unless I say otherwise. If you wish to have tea or snacks on the couch, you may, but if you get crumbs everywhere, you will be responsible for the cleanup. Am I clear?” 

That seemed simple enough. Harry nodded, and with that, they each returned to their own breakfast. The young boy rejoiced at the taste of fruit in his mouth— it tasted like heaven, after a whole week of burnt bacon. Hogwarts had spoiled him too much, with all its milk, fresh fruit, cereal, and porridge. 

He finished his meal quickly, and by habit, brought it over to the sink to wash. Professor Snape didn’t use the same dishwasher as Aunt Petunia did, but it was lemon-scented, so Harry had no complaints. Using a neatly hung washcloth, he wiped his bowl dry, and to his delight, the head of Slytherin gave him an approving nod when he was done. Just to go that step further, Harry took his professor’s bowl from the table— he was still reading the paper— and washed it up too. 

“Thank you, Harry.” hummed Professor Snape, casually reading a scandal in the ministry— the current chair of finance cheating on his wife and four-year-old daughter with his halfblood subordinate. 

“Um, where can I do my homework, sir?” 

Professor Snape lowered his paper to ponder this. “... Either your room or the living, I suppose.” 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

While he 

had 

been the one to tell Harry he could stay in his room— for homework, or whatever else the boy was getting up to in there— Severus was starting to regret it. 

“Mr. Potter,” Severus rapped on Harry’s door, trying not to feel annoyed. He had to be patient with the boy— because the Dursleys had done 

such

 a great job of raising him. “Lunch is at 12.00. It is 12.07.” 

There were a few, long seconds before the door swung open, a flushed Harry standing in the doorway. “Yes, sir. Sorry.” 

Severus couldn’t help but notice that the boy was a little stunned— most likely because, once again, the Dursleys were such a 

prime 

example of excellent parenting— and as he watched Harry stumble down the stairs, he very quickly realised what had caught the boy off guard. The boy hadn’t expected him to knock, nevermind 

wait 

outside until he came to open the door. Of course the Dursleys had a 

great 

definition of barriers. 

Lunch ended being mostly uneventful, and Severus took this opportunity to establish a few ground rules. He would be spending his summer— willingly— with the son of James Potter, one of Hogwarts’ most famed pranksters. Granted, he didn’t think Harry had the prankster mindset— or maybe he did, and the boy was smart enough to have gotten away with it— but still, the boy had organised the smuggling of a dragon out of the castle, not to mention the fact that the boy committed planned theft from Severus himself. 

“As we mentioned earlier, you 

are 

allowed to take snacks onto the couch— 

not 

your room, Mr. Potter, absolutely no eating on your bed— but you will have to clean up if you make a mess.” Severus said, “As for mealtimes, breakfast will be at 8.30 on weekdays and 9.00 on weekends, lunch is at 12.00 and dinner at 7.00. Agree?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“We might come up with a few other rules as we go along— but let me make a few things clear, Harry.” 

The boy froze at the change in tone, his entire body stiffening, his gaze pointed away. 

“Harry.” said Severus firmly, “For your entire time here— I promise I will 

not 

ever hit you, 

never

, not even for a punishment. If you ever need to be punished, it will be chores, earlier bedtime, no snacks. And as you may not enter my room without my permission, I will 

not 

enter 

your 

room without 

your 

permission, unless you are sick and being unreasonable— or that I believe you are in danger. Do you understand?”

From the way Harry was blinking, looking completely blank, he 

did not understand

. 

“My house is very different from your aunt and uncle’s.” established Severus sternly. “I do not hold the same values or beliefs that they do.” 

“...”

“Do you understand, Harry?” repeated Severus. 

“Yes, sir.” said Harry at last, nodding. He was confused, stunned and semi-grateful all rolled into one, as if he wasn’t quite sure what he was or should be feeling. 

“Good.” Satisfied at last, Severus acknowledged his answer and returned to his lunch. It was going to be a long, 

long 

summer.

Chapter 30: A Quiet, Quiet House


Notes:
I RISE FROM THE DEADsorry for the short chapter but here u go



Chapter Text

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

Number 715, Wrensbury Lane, was an oddly quiet house. Yes, it was situated in a quiet neighbourhood in a quiet town, but it was 

quiet 

even compared to its neighbours. The only resident of 715 was a lanky, tall man often dressed wholly in black, but as word would have it, he was spied a few days ago with a young, little boy, around the age of 10 to 11, by the overly-concerned Mrs. Kettler. 

Now, Wrensbury Lane was no neighbourhood with a gossip chain, but when events happened in an uneventful place, word was bound to spread. Within a day, rumours had sprouted and took over the area like an infestation of wall-climbing ivy— Wrensbury had a new resident. 

The two living in Number 715 were unknowing to all the veiled curiosity lingering outside their door. In fact, they were a little preoccupied with problems on their own. 

It had been two days, and despite housing the boy under his roof, Severus felt like he’d hardly seen Harry at all. Ironic, given that the Severus of 9 months ago would’ve wanted as little contact as possible with the boy and those bloody green eyes of his. He tried not to think about it— after all, Harry staying out of sight was a 

good 

thing, wasn’t it? He could feel morally at ease with himself— Lily’s son wouldn’t have to endure the hells of Privet Drive, but at the same time, he wouldn’t have to look into a James Potter lookalike, in the scarce days of summer he had to himself. 

Right…? 

As dinner rolled around, Harry’s door clicked open, right on time. Severus had charmed all the clocks in the house to align, because 

Merlin forbid 

the Potter spawn make an excuse about being late due to his clock slowing down. As nonchalantly as possible, the potions master glanced up from his seat on the couch, lowering his book ever so slightly to peer at Harry, who flicked his gaze at the living room clock just to make sure he wasn’t late. 

With a nod, Severus acknowledged the boy’s presence, and the two seated themselves at the dining table, where food was already warm and prepped. Mashed potatoes, ham, and green peas— not as exquisite as the buffet that Hogwarts offered, but no one had any complaints. After having been reprimanded for wolfing his food like a starved child the previous night— Severus winced at his choice of words after— Harry had taken note to slow down his eating, appreciatively taking in the food. 

Per routine from the previous two nights, Harry brought the dishes to the sink after they were finished, meticulously washing them until they were squeaky clean. Severus wasn’t sure if the boy knew of the existence of a dish-washing spell, but he wasn’t about to let the boy skip off chores. Making himself comfortable on the couch once more, the professor picked up his book and continued where he left off, watching Harry over the rim of his read. The dark-haired boy scurried around the kitchen, wiping the plates dry, arranging them on the drying rack, wiping over the counters with a rag— a clockwork routine he seemed way too used to. 

Perhaps it was the way his aunt and uncle had conditioned him, Severus thought. In the past two days, Harry had only been in sight during mealtimes— all other times, he would be eerily silent in his bedroom, to the point when Severus would have to occasionally run a spell to ensure the boy was still in the house, and that he hadn’t run away on a foolish impulse. 

“Harry,” called out the professor, making the boy freeze. The potions master had begun to familiarise himself with Harry’s cleaning routine, and knew by instinct that when Harry wiped his hands dry on the rag, he would be departing to hide in his four walls once more until breakfast the next morning. 

Awkwardly, Harry paused, folding the rag back into a pristine, neat square, hanging it on the oven handle. 

“You can work in the living room instead of hiding upstairs all day.” clarified Severus, watching the boy’s reaction carefully. There was no initial change in his composure, except a brief flash of something across his eyes— hesitancy. “... Mr. Potter, I think I should’ve made this clear— I expect you to be honest with me throughout the summer. If there’s something on your mind, voice it.” 

Harry was quiet, his fingers fidgeting again, the tell-tale sign of his nervousness— Severus was going to correct that or Merlin help him. 

“But,” hesitated the boy, “But you’re always out here.” 

“This is my house.” Severus raised an eyebrow. 

“No—! That’s not— that’s not what I meant.” mumbled Harry, shoulders drooping. 

“Then clarify what it is that you mean.” 

Harry pursed his lips, now absent-mindedly fiddling with his shirt. “I just— I didn’t want to disturb you.” 

“Why do you think you would be disturbing me?” Severus questioned, “Are you going to be loud if you work in the living? To put it literally, you are absolutely silent when you work— or whatever it is that you’re doing up there— in your room.” 

“Y-Yeah, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would always say I was being a nuisance.” mumbled Harry. “They told me to stay in my room so I wouldn’t be in the way.” 

Once again, Severus resisted the urge to pinch his nose, curse aloud, and punch someone— preferably the Dursleys. “First of all, we’ve spoken about this, Harry, do 

not 

mumble. Second— forget everything that your aunt and uncle have ever told you. 

I

 do not find you a nuisance. I willingly let you stay in my house. I should feel like I actually have a 

child 

living here instead of a silent ghost that comes out for mealtimes and disappears for the rest of the day.” 

Harry presented Severus with the same blank, semi-confused, and semi-thankful look once more. It was going to be a very, very frequent look for the next few weeks. 

“You 

are 

allowed to make noise— with a limit, of course, but I do not expect you to be deadly silent.” explained the professor, trying not to sigh. “If I wanted my house to be totally quiet, I would not have decided to house you for the summer. In fact, since I 

did 

decide to let you stay, it comes without saying that I already 

expect 

noise. For the second time: this is 

not 

your aunt and uncle’s house. The rules you were given there were unreasonable, and I will 

not 

be enforcing the same rules. Is that clear?” 

From the way Harry was staring at him, it was 

not 

clear. 

“Harry, I agreed to let you live here. That means that for as long as it is summer, you are allowed to be anywhere in the house, as long as it isn’t my bedroom and my lab downstairs.” explained Severus once more. “Do you get that?” 

“Yeah.” nodded Harry. 

“Good,” said Severus, satisfied. To his exasperation, Harry took this as the end of the conversation and swiftly exited the living area, his soft pattering footsteps echoing up the staircase, across the upper floor corridor, and into his room. The professor felt like banging his head through a table. And then through a wall. And then perhaps after that, he would make a quick trip into Privet Drive and punch Petunia in the face for what she had done to a child— her sister’s child, nonetheless. 

Before any of that could be executed, footsteps echoed from the stairwell again, this time 

down 

instead of 

up

, and there emerged Harry with a book and his pillow. 

Shyly, the boy clambered up onto the couch, made himself comfortable and snuggled in for a good read. A small smile slithered across Severus’s face as he watched Harry wrangle himself into a comfortable position, curled up against the corner of the cough, book propped against his knees. Warmth blossomed within the professor’s ribs, a small flower unfolding its petals, gently brushing against the pulse of his heart. 

────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

By the end of the week, their nightly post-dinner readings became a recurring event. Harry began enthusiastically plowing through Severus’s collections— one book a night, his emerald eyes darting over the lines, words, phrases and sentences fusing into his brain, their meaning dissolving into his mind. Severus was quietly impressed, even if he wouldn’t say so. Harry was an avid reader, and if he consumed food at the rate he consumed literature, he would, quite quickly, regain all the body weight a normal boy his age should have. 

“Professor,” said Harry quietly one night, as Severus sipped gently on his tea. On the coffee table, a small mug— that had now been designated Harry’s— was also filled with tea, and accompanied by a little chocolate chip cookie that the older man had allowed. An old, worn book sat on Harry’s lap, cover well-loved and peeling corners precariously repaired. 

“Yes, Harry,” said Severus patiently, glancing over his newspaper. The boy’s gaze was fixated on a dash of black ink across a blank page, a signature that Severus had run his hands over many, many times. 

Much to Severus’s astonishment, Harry remained wordless, and instead abandoned the book had chosen for the night, light footsteps thumping up the stairs, followed by the creak of his door— and then the resounding echo of a child haphazardly tumbling down the stairs, except Harry returned with another book in his hands. A book that Severus recognized, because only a few months ago was that book under his fingertips as he folded wrapping paper over it. 

“Professor,” said Harry, slightly breathless, eyes shining, “Did you get me this book?” 

Because across the front page lay an identical signature to the one that he had just recently discovered— 

E.Prince

, in a graceful, cursive font that perfectly summed the way Severus’s mother held herself. 

“... Yes, I did.” admitted Severus, seeing no reason to lie to the boy. “... She is my mother.” 

The corners of Harry’s glistening eyes formed a smile, and if he wasn’t holding a heavy book within his arms, Severus had a feeling he would’ve been tackled and embraced with a hug. 

“You gave me the photo of my mother?” 

“Yes, I did.” nodded Severus. “I thought you ought to own one.” 

“Thank you,” whispered Harry, his voice betraying the amount of emotion contained under the ribs that caged his heart. “I keep it on my bedside.” 

“Would you like a photo frame, perhaps?” suggested Severus, feeling oddly light. Harry was doing things to him— and if he weren’t an 11 year old boy, the potions master would suspect that he had been cursed by some kind of spell, a spell that unleashed all the locked, chained, caged feelings that he had swore never to let free again— 

The smile on Harry’s lips widened, and Severus spun away, trying to ignore the flower in his ribcage— petals growing, pushing more against his lungs— and his 

heart

— 

“I would love that.”

Please enjoy.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)




Chapter Text
────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────“I’m heading out to do some shopping after breakfast, if you’re interested,” said Severus offhandedly, over coffee and breakfast. He didn’t miss the way Harry  instantly perked up with interest— of course the Dursleys never took the boy out. Merlin knew the boy had a Vitamin D deficiency— days in Hogwarts’ dungeons didn’t do him any good, either. “I can come?” Wide-eyed, Harry stared at the professor. Severus grunted distastefully at the reaction— by Merlin, it wasn’t as if he was giving the boy the world, he was just offering him a day out in the sun— which, during summer, should come as a given, but of course Harry’s relatives deprived him of all basic human rights. “Of course you can.” sighed Severus, already getting up. With a quick flick of his wand, their dishes were discarded in the sink, and with another flick, the potions master activated the dish-washing charm. “If you are ready, we can leave at once.” (Harry was so excited he didn’t even notice the presence of the spell.) The boy was practically jumping with joy as the professor murmured a glamour to hide his lightning-shaped scar— couldn’t have the neighbours asking. With a quick once-over at the boy, and at himself, Severus deemed the two of them adequately-dressed to be out in open daylight, and off they went. Harry was enamoured with every single building on the block, running his eyes over their architecture as they ventured down the street. There was a skip in his every step, and Severus swore (in his heart) to bring the boy out more. Amazement danced in his eyes, the colour and sounds of Iveyworth all being absorbed and taken into Harry’s happy, stimulated brain. “Ah, Mr. Snape! Back for the summer?” Severus stiffened, instinctively pulling Harry behind him to face a group of beaming, overly-interested elderly women. Unable to contain his curiosity, the child peeked out from behind the professor to offer a shy smile. “Yes.” replied Severus awkwardly. “And with a little visitor?” said one of the women, giggling. “Pray, introduce the handsome little man to us.” With a weary sigh, the older man gave in, nudging Harry out, nodding to give the boy affirmation. “Go on, then. Introduce yourself.” “Hi,” said Harry, waving meekly. “I’m Harry. Harry Po—” “Harry Evans,” cut off Severus abruptly, clearing his throat. “Ah— my nephew. Yes.” “Oh, my!” exclaimed another woman disapprovingly, “You never told us about a sister, Severus! You  must bring her around some time. Well, Harry, my name is Meggy Marfrey. You may call me Ms. Marfy, if you’d like!” With this, the rest of the women chimed in with their names— Ms. Frewfield, Mrs. Brown, Ms. Writtyhill and Mrs. Rosette. “Hello,” said Harry again, “It’s nice to meet you.” “He’s such a sweet little boy,” cooed Ms. Frewfield, “Oh, he’s got your hair, Severus— and what brilliant green eyes!” At this, the rest of the women scrambled to take a good look, cooing and aahing, admiring his emerald-coloured orbs. “We must get going now, I’m afraid,” Severus said apologetically, “We must get some grocery shopping done before afternoon. Harry, say goodbye, and we’ll be on our way.” With much reluctance, the ladies bid their farewells, and the duo continued down the street, encountering even more of Iveyworth’s interested residents, although Severus hushed them all with a quick “He’s my nephew, yes, here for the summer, we must get going before lunch,”. By the time they reached the main road, Severus was considering leaving the house with an invisibility charm the next time. “Whoa,” said Harry as they stepped onto the main street, a decently-long road lined with shops on either side— a grocery shop, a bookstore, a small florist, a tailor and some local restaurant businesses. “Come,” Severus gestured, already moving towards the grocery shop, pulling a list out of his pocket, “Make haste, Harry. There will be more time for gawking after we get what we need.” As if he were clockwork, Severus perused the shelves row by row, plucking products and plopping them into their trolley cart— which Harry was more than delighted to pull. A carton of eggs, a new box of healthy cereal, oats, milk, carrots, potatoes and meat. It had taken a year to help Harry accustom to a complete diet, and Severus was  not reversing the progress that Terrence and Marcus worked so hard to accomplish. The boy would eat. “That’s about all of it.” hummed Severus, checking his watch briefly. As he turned, he noticed the boy was lagging behind, staring longingly at a shelf of chocolate cookies and bars. “Harry.” Startled, the boy flushed, clearly embarrassed, and immediately shuffled after the professor, trolley behind him. “Sorry,” he muttered. “Take one.” Severus said simply, “Just one, though. Too much chocolate is bad for your teeth.” When Harry presented him with another overly-grateful look— (for Merlin’s sake, he hadn’t cured cancer yet)— Severus had to remind himself to be patient, waiting for Harry to approach the shelf slowly, reach out for the bar he wanted, grasp his fingers around it— all while maintaining eye contact with the older man, as if Severus was going to change his mind any second. “Very well. Shall we?” Severus said, when at last Harry had the chocolate bar fully grasped in his hand. Without another word, he started heading for the counter, hearing a slight, stagnant pause before Harry’s footsteps pattered after him. (For the love of Merlin, did Petunia deprive Harry of all the delights in childhood?) “Mr. Snape!” greeted the cashier, “Welcome back. How was the school year?” “Terrible, as usual.” replied Severus dryly. “Harry, help me unload our groceries onto the counter. And say hi to Ms. Isabelle.” “Hello,” said Harry, struggling to heave up a large bag of carrots onto the counter, “I’m Harry.” Isabelle was a young girl who, like Severus, had just returned from a boarding school for the summer. “Hullo, Harry. How’d your year go? Primary school, I suppose?” “He studies where I work, actually,” said Severus, plopping the milk cartons onto the counter for Isabelle to scan. “Harry, don’t forget to give her your chocolate bar.” “Why, he’s terribly small! You can’t be any older than 9,” exclaimed Isabelle as the machine beeped twice for the milk. “Say, how old are you, Harry?” “I’m eleven,” said Harry, offering his chocolate bar to Isabelle, “Thank you.”, as she handed it back to him. “He’s a small boy,” Severus interjected, as an explanation, “Yet to hit his spurt, I suppose.” Isabelle laughed. “Well, by the look of how many potatoes and carrots Mr. Snape has got here— he intends to feed you full till you hit your spurt! Perhaps by next summer, you’ll be high enough to see over the counter.” “I hope so.” grinned Harry, standing on his tiptoes to watch Severus pay. “Here’s your receipt. Have a nice day! Come by soon again, Mr. Snape— and Harry.” waved Isabelle as they left the groceries back into the main road. As they exited the shop, Severus muttered a lightening charm on one of the bags, handing it over to Harry to carry. “Now,” glancing at his watch, “We’ve got time before we ought to be back in time to make lunch— pick one shop to explore, Harry.” Taking a moment to ponder, the boy decided, and as Severus expected— pointed to the direction of the book shop. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────“Off to bed with you,” said Severus as Harry yawned for the fifth time.“But it’s not bedtime yet,” protested Harry, resisting another yawn, “And I want to finish this chapter before I sleep—”“The book will still be here when you wake up tomorrow, Harry,” interrupted Severus, wondering how any spawn of James Potter could be such a book addict, “You were out for half the morning and spent the rest of the afternoon traipsing around my garden like a baby fawn. Off to bed with you.” With one last pout, Harry got off the couch, leaving his new book on the coffee table, dragging his blanket and pillow with him up the stairs. “When I check on you in 15 minutes, you better be asleep and not reading a book under your covers,” said Severus over his shoulder, practically sensing the way Harry slumped despite not being able to see the boy. “Goodnight, Harry.” From the top of the stairs came a reply, mid-yawn. “Goodnight, professor.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────When Harry woke, he wasn’t in his bed in Number 715, Wrensbury Lane, Iveyworth, in Professor Snape’s home. Instead, he was standing in an oddly familiar living room, a cosy red couch in the centre of the space facing a fireplace. Photo frames of a dark-haired baby boy lined the walls, interspaced with those of a three-member family, one of a fat cat, and of a beaming couple on their wedding day. “Hullo, little prongsling.” Harry turned, surprising to see a man not previously there, with dark hair and wrinkled hazel eyes. It took him a moment, but very quickly he connected the dots. The man before him was the one in the photos— and the more he looked, the surer he was— the man was none other than James Charlus Potter, smiling and grinning, in life, in body, in skin, right in front of him. “Youngest seeker in a century!” declared James, “A bit disappointing that you’re playing for the snakes, of course— but I couldn’t be any prouder of you.” Stunned, the boy stood in place as his father stepped towards him, a calloused hand ruffling his hair. "I think your mother and I did a good job," James hummed, "You got the best from both of us! My talent in transfiguration and charms, oh, and quidditch, of course— your mother's talent in potions, her kindness and her compassion. Pity you don’t have the redhead temperament— you could do with being a little fiercer, but that’s fine.” The man smiled, puffing out his chest in pride. “My little lookalike,” said James, unable to resist ruffling his son’s hair once more, “We’re very proud of you, kiddo, and we want you to know— Slytherin or not, your mother and I are very,  very  proud of you, and that we love you with  everything we have.” Harry could feel a warm streak trickling down his cheek, steadily followed by more tears as he found that he was unable to speak. There was so much he wanted to say to his father— but no matter how hard he tried, his voicebox refused to cooperate. “We love you, Harry.” said James, although he was starting to disappear, like smoke diffusing into the air. “More than you can ever imagine.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Severus snapped awake in a start, something within his bones sensing that something wasn't right. The last he remembered, he had fallen asleep on the couch, book still in his lap— but he was no longer there. Instead, he was standing on the front lawn of Godric’s Hollow, a ghost of the house, still intact and pristine, as if it had never been attacked and blown apart. “Harry,” he breathed, seeing the misty figure of the eleven-year-old boy within the house. “Harry, get out of there— fuck, Harry—!” “Severus, calm down.” said a voice Severus hadn’t heard in years, not since— “Lily,” Severus breathed, feeling his heart sink into his stomach. Desperately, Severus tried to legilimens a mind wall around himself— Merlin, who was trying to attack him through his mind, and how would they know— to use Lily, and Godric’s Hollow, and  Harry —Lily smiled warmly at him, although he could see a tint of sadness in her eyes, as if she was pitying him— how his first instinct was to brace for an attack, but who could blame him when years of warfare had shaped him into the broken man he now was? “You are going to be an amazing parent, Severus,” she said, “I just know it. Harry loves you with so much of himself, he doesn’t even realise, and you’ve done so much to help him heal and grow.” Severus stared at her, dumbfounded. “I just hope he can help  you  heal, too.” Before Severus could catch his bearings, he was whisked away, the shadowy figure of Harry still inside the house, deaf to Severus’s calls out to him. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Forlorn, Harry watched as the delusion of his father faded away. Good things never last, he supposed— but while the memory of James Potter may have disappeared, the warm, loving feeling the man instilled in him still lingered within Harry’s chest, wrapping his heart in an embrace, like a home-knit sweater. The creators of his hypothetical sweater may have gone, but their everlasting love lived on within each knit and stitch. “Oh, my baby.” Said the soft voice of a woman, a voice that caressed him and coddled him in its arms. Harry spun around, somehow knowing who to expect when his gaze settled on an auburn woman with the same green eyes he saw whenever he stared into a mirror. Lily Evans smiled lovingly at him, her eyes crinkled around the edges as she took in the sight of her baby, all grown up into a young boy now. “You’ve grown so much,” she whispered, moving so she could kneel before him, her misty hands reaching to wipe a tear off his cheek. “My baby boy.” Harry opened his mouth, half-crying as he mouthed the words he wanted so much to say. Once again, his voicebox refused to work— but from the way Lily’s expression softened, she knew exactly what it was that he couldn’t vocalise. “I love you too, baby.” she said, pressing a gentle kiss on his forehead. The display of affection felt so innately familiar that Harry instinctively tucked himself into her chest, her kiss a soft breeze against his skin. “You have been so, so brave. So brave, and so persistent, and ever so kind.” She was running her fingers through his hair now, brushing through the soft, black locks. “You’ve come so far, and you’ve still got so much further to go.” Lily smiled, pride shining through her features. “Whether you want to be an auror, like your father, or a healer— you’ll always be our baby. So don’t you worry about anything, and go be what you want to be, alright?” Before Harry could respond— through his tears— that he would not ever, ever let them down, his mother started dissipating into the air, and eventually the living room, too, started to blur out, and everything was, suddenly, black again. ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────When Severus opened his eyes again, the face of James Charlus Potter stared back at him, unscarred with the fresh, flawless beauty of everlasting youth. “I guess we’re even.” said the voice of supposed-to-be-dead Potter. The youthful smile of a young adult, one that hadn’t seen the horrors of the world, slipped onto the lips of the man who was partly responsible for Severus's childhood hell. Ironic, as Severus remembered exchanging hexes and curses with the fierce duellist that the Gryffindor was, under the comfort of his mask. One might say that James Potter was naive, but one could not say that the man was unexposed to the horrors of the world. In fact, Severus was certain that James Potter knew to the full extent how grim those days were. Severus himself knew. “And I guess I can’t call you  Snivellus anymore. Pity.” the man sighed, the glints of charm dancing in his eyes. His body was relaxed and untense; not the kind of posture Severus would adopt when facing off against the enemy of his school years. “Even?” sneered Severus, unable to refrain himself before the man he loathed oh-so-much. The man whose features passed along onto the boy that Severus now housed under his roof, under the name of his “nephew”. The longer he looked, the more he found similarities tying Harry James to his father. “Does the  whomping willow ring any bells?”Silence bounced between the two; James, with his relaxed, casual stance, dressed in a warm, faded sweater, marriage ring as shiny as the day it was bought; Severus, tense, a trapped animal ready to spring, wand gripped tightly in his hand. “... I’m sorry.” said the man out of the blue, hazel eyes soft with genuinity. “And  no , Lily did not set me up for this. I really am sorry. I was an absolute jerk to you when we were younger, and nothing I say can excuse it.” If he was completely caught off guard, Severus was good enough to hide it— with a well-practiced sneer, one that graced his face with the familiarity that James’s smirk did for him. “Where’s this coming from? I never took you to be self-reflecting,  Potter .” “I watched him, you know.” James cut in, unbothered by the excess of snark injected in the other’s reply. “Harry. I watched that  cousin  of his,” Disdain coloured the man’s voice as he spoke, “I watched that overfed, obese  brat  mistreat my son for  years . And it took a while— but I realised that I was just as bad as that boy. That I was to you what Dudley was to Harry.” All of Severus’s practiced sarcasm abandoned him, just like that, leaving him speechless and vulnerable before the last man he wanted to see him at his worst. “And for that I apologise.” “Thank you, Severus. It hurts me to admit this—” James chuckled, “But Harry couldn’t be any better off than in your hands. Please take care of him for me— for  us .” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────Jumping awake, Severus whirled out of his seat, book falling onto the ground, leaping up the stairs in a bat-ly fashion. He didn’t know what to make of the whole dream-like sequence he had just witnessed, but all he knew was that his mind was yelling at him to check on Harry, check on Harry,  check on Harry — Thankfully, the boy was safe— for this, Severus allowed himself a breath of relief, before he realised the continuous tracks of tears streaming down Harry’s face. The child didn’t speak, but from his own experiences, Severus had a feeling he knew the cause. “It’s okay.” said Severus softly, settling onto the bed next to Harry. Embarrassed, the boy turned, stuffing his teary face into a pillow, muffling his cries into sniffling. They sat in silence for a while, until Harry had rid of all the bittersweet happiness in his system. Swallowing thickly, the boy wiped away the remaining wetness on his shirt sleeve, and while Severus typically would’ve, he couldn’t find it in himself to tell the boy off at that moment. “Harry,” said Severus at last. “Y-Yeah?” sniffled Harry. The older man hesitated, but breathed in deeply and went on with it. “... I didn’t know your father well. He and I… We didn’t exactly get along, and if you want to know about him, you’re better off asking Minerva, or Lupin, perhaps— but know this, Harry. When people say that your father was a brave man… He was. He was— is— a brave man.” “...” “Do you know why, Harry?” “Because he died protecting me and my mother?” Severus shook his head, but smiled wryly. Of course it would James Potter— of them all— who died a heroic death. The typical Gryffindor. “Partially, yes. Listen carefully to what I say. I’m not going to repeat this for you, Harry.”The boy nodded, shuffling closer. Severus composed himself— Merlin, he couldn’t believe the words that he was about to utter. While Severus didn’t know if it was the actual ghosts of the two deceased that visited him— and quite possibly Harry, from how shaken the boy had been— there was no doubt in his body any longer that it was some manifestation of the late Potters that they had seen. With James’s words still ringing in his mind, the older Slytherin spoke: “The bravest man of all, Harry, is the one who can admit and apologise for his mistakes.” ────────── ⋅❉⋅ ──────────

*bows*thank u for sticking with me this whole way! see yall in book 2! :)goodbye for now!edit: someone asked for the symbolism of the title (which i promised, a long, long time ago), so here it is! it's not very deep lolthe mulberry tree symbolises "protection, strength, sorrow, loyalty". in greek mythology, a pair of star-crossed lovers died under a mulberry tree, staining the white berries red, symbolizing love and the union in death (lily & james). in japanese mythology, they symbolize "support, nurturing (severus to the kids), and self-sacrifice (lily & james)"30/12/2023 Update:Black Mulberry: The PDF Version- as asked for, here is the PDF version of the book (because AO3 exports with chapter notes and I know I have a ton of those) so here's a clean, chapter-only PDF of the entire book, straight from my 300-paged Google Docs. Much love.
